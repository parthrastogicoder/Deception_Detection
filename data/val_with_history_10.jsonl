{"messages": ["good afternoon to our friends in the south just sending this message to open a channel for future relations when ever they need to happen and to say howdy and have a good game to you", "of course i thank you very much the future of the kaissereich and its effect on my neighbors will be very important to me so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack", "well should the french turn out to be a thorn in my side i would greatly appreciate the aid", "greetings from new italy", "would just like to reiterate that italy would likely take an opportunistic stance towards france their defensive position is strong enough that i wont attack them proactively but if they are locked into a conflict with you i might stab them", "so in that sense italy is broadly friendly to your interests if you and france are allied i will leave you alone but if france is your enemy i could potentially help you to break a stalemate", "but what id need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the west are you leaning towards working with england or france", "it seems for the moment that both are cooperative but im likely to side with the french from the outset barring difficulties with them ill keep you posted same relationship as previously established in any case friendship with the french is not very likely to last past englands demise so ill definitely need the help then thank", "makes sense hopefully ill be on the winning side of a conflict against turkey or austria by then which should put us in position to squeeze france", "id greatly prefer you end up on austrias side of that conflict all things considered but if things dont go his way i wouldnt blame you for siding against them", "definitely understandable but since italy starts off as one of the weaker countries i basically need to play a little opportunistically", "the elephant in the room is russia would you have any insight on what theyre planning", "unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each others ways", "haha didnt try to hold sweden hostage to get him to play nice with austria thats my usual goto as germany lol", "have you talked more with austria i must admit to being concerned about you moving to tyrolia in their defense", "since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on venetia", "as germany i generally play somewhat more careful get them to just promise not to be an enemy until the western triple becomes a western double as far as austria goes were allied hence my preference for turkey being your foe rather than them ive no intent of turning south though not by any means dont have the pieces for that", "yeah fair enough im planning on a pretty standard opening to ionian sea aiming to convoy to tunis and with a bounce in austria", "its a pretty noncommittal move so will wait and see how things play out", "but im sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the lepanto if the cards fall that wau", "well the lepanto setup is generally considered italys best opener regardless of whether they trust austria hard to argue with a classic", "its looking like the russians and the turks are trying a juggernaut", "if they do that we desperately need to be strongly allied with the austrians otherwise theyll roll us over hard", "i am also concerned about the juggernaut which pushes me towards you and austrias camp", "it seems france and england are at a loggerhead already so if you side with england it might be an opportunity for me as well", "our interests are aligned in both sides of the map so lets just coordinate closely", "id be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support austria against turkey if i knew you were going to burgundy which makes it harder for france to convoy to tuscany", "frances f marseille is a major headache for me", "what say you", "france is definitely going to be a thorn in your side unfortunately i can neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you theyre more powerful than i am and ive already pissed off two of my three potentially unfriendly neighbors", "the balkan front is pretty secure for you two though you can at least hold and with some tricky maneuvering very easily begin advancing through the turks", "understood know that austria and italy are not going to be able to hold out against russia and turkey", "if you want to prevent a juggernaut we will need whatever help from you we can get", "well as im sure youve noticed ive mobilized for the task", "ive talked to the french to try and get them off your back but theyre dedicated to seeing you off they told me to tell you that they plan to attack piedmont with support which indicates that theyre probably planning a convoy to tuscany you cant let that happen", "well it seems the attack on piedmont with support was genuine which seems like a very poor decision by the french", "yeah maybe they predicted that youd think they were lying to me regardless bad move on their part in any case especially since you have a build", "good news for you though a distracted france is still more than enough firepower to get you through england and it makes it easy for you to stab them after", "i dont know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking i would disbelieve it and go to tuscany but no hard feeling if so", "thats jsut well played", "it certainly does i wish theyd let you get on with destroying the turks so you could focus fire on them when its needed but still and i gave you that information because i genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they told me to tell you so they could do something else was worried that theyd do the convoy because that would be devastating for you", "haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me since i attempted the same convoy as france in the previous game", "so would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the warning", "yeah its a real powermove as the french to pull off that convoy", "well it didnt work for me either", "well experienced italys generally see it coming", "indeed", "im trying to do damage control with the austrians it was incredibly damaging for them to do that and i cant imagine why theyve decided to side with the turks rather than you if it doesnt work out im going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with the turks", "i was taken very surprised in large part because i didnt see and still dont see what they stand to gain", "and if they really stand to gain ground why not make a play for venice", "no idea the y apparently arent interested in working with you anymore im quite frankly pulling my hair over this its the worst possible move", "i find myself very confused by it as well which is part of why i am not quite sure how to respond", "would you be willing to coordinate against a tyrolia id be happy to support a munich in", "im afraid that if i do that my current position could quickly become untenable im worried that the austrians are planning something funky", "alright so i realize that this is a little bit late but now that the austrians are embroiled with the turks i am moving against the french im trying to convince the austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you but i would understand if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you", "you stabbing the french is already a massive lifeline to me i could not in good conscious ask you to do more", "i will listen to what austria has to say and keep you updated on that front i do not really trust them but i may still be willing to work with them against the turks if they say the right things", "im moving on the french this next season hopefully theyll pull back to face me and you and the british will be able to surge back against them", "im pleasantly surprised that youre so willing to work with england as well", "in that case ill play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive", "well the english are a little miffed that i didnt move last season but still i see no reason not to work with them for the time being", "yeah agreed the english are too desperate to turn down your support", "conversely you have a free walk into paris right now", "since france has only fleets", "a mun bur and then to paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a potential stab on mun which you could easily do with a ber", "and then a holbel isnt quite as foolproof but is pretty safe as well", "especially if you support yourself into nth and move kie hol", "if youre wondering who convinced the french to make it a fleet you need go no further", "well sounds like things are in good shape", "hopefully the french are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack", "yeah ill make the most of this", "the austrians wouldnt happen to be talking about me would they", "i havent heard anything from them", "well at the very least thats good im worried about them potentially deciding that they want warsaw despite the fact that im on the right side of a stalemate line where theyd only get 1 supply center if they attacked", "are you coordinating with the turks i think that for the time being that would be a good idea", "yeah am trying to do so", "not to be needy or anything but i would greatly appreciate a hard move for venice this next year", "i will make a play for venice this fall", "if i was in austrias shoes i would do a self bounce of f ven tri a ser tri", "so i plan to do f alb s f ven tri a apu ven", "odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with a tyr s a apu ven would you be willing to do so", "gas and bur likely cannot take mar anyways so in my view you would be better off using a par a pic s a gas bre f nth s f bel eng a bur mun", "this would be a nearguarantee that you take brest and would occupy f eng as a consolation prize in the only outcome where you didnt while still covering munich", "my only problem with that plan is that it risks losing burgundy if the french pull a fast one and go for silesia instead while moving marseilles into burgundy", "thats a valid point my view is that a mar bur is unlikely but a boh sil is a real risk", "if you want to keep france out of bohemia a gal is the only unit you have that can do so", "which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe bud", "although actually if you hit vienna and france has two disbands they may struggle to keep up the pressure around silesia", "thats true i dont know if i want to take my chances with that though", "ill probably move into vienna but im not sure i can afford to move out of burgundy", "understood so then you would use a gal to cover warsaw a bur to cover munich and then try to snipe vienna with a tyr", "correct"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

were told to lepanto the turks though im not sure if its a good idea", "were the only ones i trust to understand how unlikely a solo is and you seem interested in cooperation so ill honestly put all my chips under your bag and defend you until the end if youre willing to do the same with me", "at the very least we can give one hell of a ride", "i havent been told to do a lepanto yet who said that and yes i would like peace on our front i could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you and i did not fight where would you expand to then", "i will be moving into ven with tri traditional austrian opening and fully understand that you would go ven to tri as a response so that we bounce if you can come up with a good alternative then i am fine with that but i dont see one", "i am perfectly comfortable with a ventri bounce so no need for further discussion on that point would like to suggest that we demilitarize tyrolia at least for year one as well", "would like to get your thoughts on your other moves is a budapest going to serbia and is a vienna going to galicia or allowing russia in", "okay the bounce sounds good and i would love to demilitarize tyr for this year and we can talk about it again then", "why do you need my moves", "i think in general it pays to know as much as possible about what everyone is doing even if they lie it helps you get an early picture on who is trustworthy p", "but i think the austria italy relationship is bigger than that", "austria and italy are two countries which can easily fall into a mutually destructive war until they both get eaten by turkey", "but its also very hard for us to trust each other since its so easy to stab thats a big part of what makes these two countries so challenging for a lot of players right", "in that sense it helps for us to be open with each other its a very different game for me if russia gets into galicia early putting them and turkey in place to roll the map compared to if you and turkey push russia out of rumania in year one", "in that context im pretty comfortable telling you that i dont plan to get greedy in year 1 as long as i can secure tunisia while keeping a secure defensive position im happy", "i 100 do not want to fight you i agree that austria italy is a war that often happens but never really works out for either side we would just stagnate until russia or turkey or both took us out", "on that note i have heard rumors that turkey and russia are gonna go for a juggernaut if that is the case id assume you would help me slow them down", "probably dont need to point this out but you allying with turkey would eventually lead to him attacking you unless you stabbed him first", "definitely agree that assuming we can trust each other the austriaitaly alliance tends to be more stable than the austriaturkey one", "turkey and russia bounced in the black sea but that proves little since juggernaut allies often go for that anyways", "russia has committed pretty hard to the south which is mildly concerning for both of us in the event that the juggernaut materializes however my sense is that germany would also be willing to support us", "i guess for this year suggest that we do the ventri bounce again i would suggest to keep turkey out of greece and use vienna to defend against russia", "i will convoy a apulia to tunisia", "all sounds good to me", "have you talked to turkey much", "not a whole lot their move to the black sea was news to me", "so turkey went back on their deal with me and tried to let russia get rum while they snuck into gre juggernaut confirmed", "id like to propose that you and i go full alliance", "im game for the lepanto and it seems germany is on board as well", "what does that look like in practice germany builds in berlin you in budapest", "and then hit rumania in spring", "not positive what i would do yet but something along those lines you would definitely build a fleet in nap and then move ion to eas", "france and turkey are trying to get me to attack you obviously i will not do that", "with the build in marseilles frances goals are quite transparent", "turkey will likely bounce me in eas would you be willing to support me into greece via convoy", "from there i can support you into bulgaria", "im willing to debate it but i had a different view on this turn i figured he would bounce you in eas but what if you went for aeg instead unless youre worried about over extending yourself due to france because i trust you enough at this point to move tri to alb and then we will definitely be able to get gre in the fall", "which makes going to aegeas a bit of an overstretch", "if we can get germany on board id feel a lot more comfortable with committing east", "sorry some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order", "but basically im concerned about frances f marseille so a little nervous about committing both fleets east", "but i think having germany attack france would ease that", "so in theory if we could not get germany to attack france what kind of attack would you be comfortable with us making", "in which case convoying onto greece is the best use of the fleet and army id have available", "okay i will support that can you move out of ven", "so i am in a slightly sticky situation but i think i can get out of it if i support you holding in gre then would you move that fleet into eas", "also germany and france are allied however germany is also willing to help us out", "let me know what youre thinking", "germany and france allying is not ideal for me but i feel confident in observing that turkey and russia are allied as well", "so desperate times call for desperate measures may need to do what needs to be done to stop the juggernaut", "would appreciate you helping me to hold in greece and well need whatever help from germany that we can get", "i can still support a serbia buglaria as well if that helps", "look at the moves from last turn turkey tried to support me attacking russia why do you think they are still allied", "to put it simply i missed that i find backstabbrs map interface hard to read and didnt see it in the list of orders", "which i will look at more carefully going forward", "i gotcha so you are clearly going after turkey right now but have to deal with france whatre you thinking in regards to that whole situation because i have to figure out whether or not i can use turkey as a short term ally vs russia", "however i view you as my most important ally which is why im asking you about all this", "i have moved against turkey but i am willing to back down to focus on france", "if you would rather coordinate with turkey against russia im open to the idea of a southern triple as turkey suggested", "i mean turkey knows that you and i are allied so i think that if you attack him then he will attack me i dont really wanna fight him and russia at the same time", "do you think you can gain supply centers vs france i get that you need to expand somewhere", "whatre you thinking for this season", "i most likely cant gain a supply center this year but i should be able to gain ground as long as neither you nor turkey stab me", "my thinking is that ill go with the conservative option", "which is f tys s f rome tus a tus ven", "and then withdraw f eas ion", "should put me in position to push through wes starting fall while covering all my bases defeinsively", "that all seems logical", "what are you thinking f alb s a gre h would be appreciated in my perspective", "neither of us have a good reason to stab you we gotta focus on russia", "yeah naturally im concerned about what turkey will do once russia is defeated but thats a question for another day", "ill do that it keeps turkey from snagging gre", "do you have germany on your side as well", "so am i id expect they go through me before they go through you that is why i need you", "turkey has sev in their pocket which might open up a path to moscow", "for now he supported me into war which is nice so i will keep working with them", "but they might want it for themselves", "that is true", "makes sense keep me posted", "will do we gotta take another russia center this year", "not immediately relevant to us but i feel like sweden will be interesting too", "just because russia has a good shot at holding it if they can play england and germany against each other", "yeah i reached out to england to see what they think about all of this", "england seems to be a bit pessimistic which is probably justified facing a francegermany coalition", "although the fact that france is quite committed in the south and germany in the east improves their position a lot", "so about this whole greece affair", "understandably you would be mad at me about it i honestly just felt like i could use it better than you could", "i realize that sounds rude", "at least you have that much selfawareness we opened this game stating that conflict between italy and austria is usually selfdefeating but it is hard for us to trust each other", "now that you have betrayed that trust i dont really see a path forward away from that mutually destructive conflict", "understandable", "so you are now in conflict with all three of your allies", "all three of your neighbors", "france may defeat me but most likely you wouldnt see any centers from that and you wont win against turkey and germany", "i dont trust you enough to seek an alliance but wouldnt a ceasefire be mutually beneficial", "both of us have our backs against the wall", "yes a cease fire sounds perfect i need to handle turkey", "i understand why you dont trust me however notice that i have not helped france and dont actually want to see you off the board", "of course a cease fire is mutually beneficial enough that id have little doubts", "but that said if you want to win back my trust supporting me into venice would be a great start", "with a vie tyr f tri s a romven", "i would be guarrenteed to take it with no sc downside risk to you", "so about your move to the ionian", "turkey refuses to work with me", "well thats good news for me if you dont mind me saying so", "lol yeah i know", "well done on slipping into serbia", "i assume you aim to push further in the balkans", "not really sure yet i think this game is a lost cause for me", "not sure if now is the right time for told you sos but my statement that italyaustria conflict would ultimately lead to both of us going down seems pretty on the mark right now", "hahahahaha", "i suck as austria", "to be fair austria is one of the harder countries on the map", "you basically need to play both sides with russia and turkey just to have a chance at winning", "even if youre only aiming for second place or to survive and draw you need to pick your partners well", "haha i appreciate it italy is obviously hard as well i have a weird affection for playing it though", "so this is the point in the game where you probably need to start thinking about your goals", "if your goal is to survive you would be best placed in going into moscow and then slipping into scandinavia", "germany has pivoted strongly west so they would not easily retake it", "and a draw would likely be germany plus whatever opposing alliance occupying german territory would make you a key part of that draw alliance", "alright heres an offer", "if you can capture st petersburg from germany while holding on to moscow", "and that enables us to stalemate against germany", "we can include you as one of the survivors in the draw", "i can probably get turkey on board for this france would have no choice but to accept", "yeah im gonna try and stop germany", "understood i will stay out of budapest you should be able to

turkey doesnt build a lot of fleets i would like to not have to build a lot of fleets are you comfortable not putting fleet pressure on me it frees you up for other things maybe an early go against france or an austrian sandwich", "a seems like it was great", "b im fine if you dont want to build fleets it would be interesting and powerful for you if we had a infantrynaval power dynamic but i understand if thats uncomfortable to you i was planning on going all out with naval power but i think our alliance could be really important depending on how things swing so ill accept cutting back", "greetings from new italy also was scanning the previous messages and noticed you were in durham is that durham england or durham nc", "but yeah i am largely aligned with the previous players view that turkey and italy can make for a great alliance as long as turkey is more army focused", "nc and great to hear", "where are you from", "haha i went to school in durham nc", "ive moved out of the country now though spent the last two years in hong kong and in brussels right now", "small world haha", "but yeah gamewise i aim to be pretty defensive year one if i secure tunisia im happy", "austria has been really cagey with me which probably means they have a plan and im not a part of it might be good news for you or might not depending on whether youve reached an understanding with them or not", "good to know i havent set anything in stone with him i like to send both my armies north as italy everyone wants to talk to me in fall 01 thats for sure", "out of curiosity how is your relationship with russia i assume the bounce in black sea was prearranged", "also how is durham these days", "durham is amazing the city has really gone through a transformation have you played in any european facetoface diplomacy events or are you only an online player", "black sea was prearranged", "ok austria is out of position and only gets one build would you like to work together and take him down", "ive played face to face with irl friends but never gone to a face to face event with serious players", "makes sense that black sea was prearranged are they on board with occupying it now", "id be willing in principle to attack austria but want to check what russia has to say as well", "not sure need to talk with him", "that was wrt to the black sea bounce", "yeah fair enough", "i would be so happy if your fleet went to adriatic this spring can we find a peace in the mediterranean", "russia building in moscow makes me think that he isnt worried about austria an austriarussia collaboration isnt good for me and it probably isnt the best thing for you in the long run thoughts", "agree that i wouldnt want to see a russiaaustria collaboration but not sure if id make too much of it", "after being kept out of sweden its natural for russia to feel that they need to invest more in the north", "currently frances fleet marseille is a big headache for me", "but if youre willing to support me into greece which would be done by convoy i could follow up by occupying adriatic", "why dont you convoy into albania", "i would like to have a build and greece seems like the likely target", "im thinking what do you see as a fair split of austrian dots between us if were going to work together", "alright i might be asking for some help into serbia in the fall", "i would say trieste greece to me and then serbia and budapest to you you would probably pick up rumania as well in this scenario but need to see how russia plays regarding vienna", "lets do this", "its come to my understanding that you had no intention of turning on austria this fall if youre not motivated to attack him and i understand why youd prefer not to go to war with your neighbor when france is playing in your backyard perhaps the three of us can work together and try to force a wedge in the western triple allow austria and i to focus on russia and you get into a more threatening posture against france", "i basically sent this to austria ive replaced the pronouns so that it makes sense to you ok i now realize that theres no western triple instead its an fg which is just as bad for you guys since germany is already into russia heres my idea and take it or leave it but i suggest that italy keep rotating his fleets out maybe move towards wes and tun while austria backfills ion italy builds a fleet in rom and austria can convoy greece into nap in the spring now italys got three fleets in play while france is trying to land a unit on england meanwhile austria moves the army out of ser and towards munich and i move bulrum north into sev mos and war its a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the balkans", "youre really forcing the fleet build i wanted to build armies but youre forcing the fleet build", "id like to start by apologizing the turn change comes first thing in the morning my time and your message was sent after i had went to sleep as a result i did not see it until i got off work just now and did not give it proper consideration", "my alliance with austria against you was based on the premise that you and russia were planning on a juggernaut alliance that needs to be stopped as soon as possible and that your move to the black sea was a concession on russias part to grease the wheels of that alliance", "your stab on russia in bulgaria has proven those premises to be false yet my move to eas puts us in conflict nonetheless", "for what its worth i will build a fleet in rome as you had requested as it is necessary to cover france", "if you are willing to build an army in con as well i would take that as a strong indicator of your desire for cooperation but would understand if you feel that is not an option for you", "i think you need an army in venice my friend", "ill consider the army", "the army in venice is more important for my immediate defensive position but a fleet in rome puts me in a better place to slip through wes and attack france", "that being said if i felt confident that you would allow me to return to ion building an army in venice would be safer", "i think that would be mutually beneficial seeing as youre probably not a fan of forcing me to stay in eas either", "im gonna roll the dice and build a con", "you wont regret it", "well i see you got cold feet regarding the a con build", "cant say i blame you", "i hope that youll at least let me withdraw to ion", "certainly", "ughhh that was unfortunate can you effectively defend against both austria and france any thoughts", "defensively i can defend against them easily if they are not coordinated if they are i should be able to hold out for some time but it is ultimately a losing battle", "of course thats assuming that you remain neutral in this if you pick a side in this conflict either me or austria should be able to cruise to victory", "i currently have the upper hand against france and dont face any disbands since a greece disbanded anyways but a hostile austria makes it tifficult to commit to gaining ground against france", "what are your thoughts", "austria has been a valuable ally for you against russia and can support you into moscow if you were so inclined but germany could do the same their value to you on that front is reaching its limits", "i wouldnt be able to support you as much from greece as i was in the past since even if i were to somehow reclaim it it would be with a fleet instead of an army but i would still be willing to put pressure on trieste to help you claim serbiabudapest", "my thoughts on your comments are you are correct i dont plan on attacking you with my fleets", "on the other hand im not sure i want to attack austria", "not sure im a fan of you occupying the ionian", "ill just point out that austria is highly exposed to an attack from you and germany has turned on that", "attacking them would be an easy win", "well not easy right now i kept my word to you about not attacking you with my fleets what are your plans with ion", "apologies missed this message", "but to be honest given my situation with france and austria i am at your mercy right now", "i have no choice but to offer myself as the junior partner in a italyturkey alliance if you stab me i will rapidly be conquered by france", "that said i believe i still have value as an ally i can help you to keep austrias navy bottled up and help you break through austria and on to germany", "i agree we certainly can and should work together", "i think you might make it out of this alive what is stopping germany from walking into paris this year", "not much honestly and germany also told me that theyre ready for a stab on france you didnt hear this from me", "of course ill believe it when i see it but ill do everything i can to encourage that", "apologies for missing the turn", "but would you be willing to support me into the ionian against austria", "will aim to get into the ionian this turn what are your thoughts on austria", "fucker needs to go", "i assume were working together at this point anything i can do to help", "not sure if my previous message didnt go through or if you just didnt have a chance to reply", "but just want to reiterate that my goal is a partition of austria and will move into alb", "new turn is up", "not sure if you didnt see my message or just didnt trust it but it is regrettable that you felt the need to defend greece and lost serbia as a result", "f ion is happy to help you hold greece my draft order is f ion s gre h but let me know if you would prefer something else", "on my end i will do my best to try and take either venice or triste but it might be difficult given the lack of support", "what are your thoughts aiming for bulgaria", "yes please support me i greece i will attack bulgaria", "will do ill try to play for venicetrieste as well but expect that it wont succeed", "good luck its probably best to support trieste in and try to slip into venice", "in case he tries to selfbounce", "i think you need another army", "yeah will hope for the selfbounce and aim to snipe", "was hoping to get germanys assistance but it looks like that wont happen", "agree that i need another army but will need to secure the build first for that to happen p", "bouncing an idea do you think i should build my army in naples", "a ven s f alb tri a ion c a nap alb would be the fastest way to ramp up the pressure on austria", "but i wont do it if you dont sign off", "so if you prefer ill do the more conventional build of a rome", "actually we need to do something about germany", "they only need to absorb england and france to win", "i know ive been asking austria to do something about germany for a long time", "go for naples i think youre got a good set of moves planned", "are you planning to hit serbia again", "if so do you need my a alb to support", "how bout i support you in", "if you cut adr with ion youll get in you might even keep trieste", "my plan was either alb ser or have you hit ser to cut support and the ion adr which should let me hold tri", "but if youre willing to support me in i would appreciate that as well", "seems like this turn went well for us", "and as to the germany issue we can probably grab budapest and then try to snipe vienna next year", "if we can seize vienna and france holds on to portugal that should be enough to stall germanys victory for a year", "well we managed to break through austria", "but likely germany will win", "lets try to coordinate with france and austria to prevent a german victory but might be a lost cause at this point", "agreed im not attacking austria", "we need to prop up austria that means supporting him to hold in vienna etc",

loss of portugal which is two coin flips not losing 2 of the 3 russian centers youre going to lose stp the question then becomes how to we preserve warsaw my recommendation is a vie s tyr boh a war ukr a stp mos a bud gal i tyr boh i tri tyr i ven pie i tus s ven pie t sev ukr t rum s war ukr t ank sev convoy this plan destroys ukr or ensures that we control it it places units in places that they can cut supports on warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we dont chances are if stp is dislodged it will be able to retreat to lvn worst case is that germany just rotates his armies north supporting himself into lvn and getting three on warsaw lvn pru and sil but well either be in moscow or galicia probably both and ukraine well

{"messages": ["seems the game has conspired to make us natural allies once again", "hows that", "oh you know austria germany its generally considered suicide to go after each other", "and yes im always happier as austria when germany lets people know that we are allies", "you said once again though", "oh well you were italy in game 9 yes", "howd you figure that out", "well youre the only one that was in both games and both discord channels process of elimination", "gotcha hahaha", "hopefully it isnt an issue with the study that we figured it out", "well they did say that anonymity was optional", "sounds good", "so whatre you seeing from the board so far", "russia hasnt spoken much but enough for me to know that they arent my enemy italy is maintaining friendly terms with me and the french seem pretty insistent that we can be allies as well i think that if all is as it seems the corner powers turks and english are the most in trouble at the moment", "this is of course barring treachery", "id assume you will be trying to recruit france to go for england then", "thats the hope yes", "this group doesnt seem very chatty", "certainly doesnt might be easier to go outside and squeeze trees for sap", "the italians are eying you up as a potential enemy", "everything proceeds according to plan thusfar", "can you do me a favor and bounce russia in swe since they tried to hit gal and ill try to talk to italy because i dont really wanna fight them", "ill try talking to the russians first but if i think theyre lying to me or if they refuse ill bounce them", "actually nevermind im not going to speak with them ill just bounce them you can count on at least one army coming your direction to help with them after this season", "looks like theyre going to try a juggernaut i may have to alter my western triple plans accordingly", "ouch i was going to ask turkey to support me into rum for a take or a bounce either way it would hold russia from building", "thanks for the heads up we will see what turkey says", "yeah the russians and turks seem to have arranged that bounce for the black sea while the russians maneuvered south they want us to think that theyre not friends until the moment they start supporting each other around ill talk to the russians and turks to see if i can squeeze some info out of them eh", "sounds good im trying to smooth things out with italy right now", "ill talk to england and let you know if i hear anything", "the english and i are for the time being on good terms but any wild cards you could find out for me would be appreciated", "reached out to france as well so i will let you know looks like they might fight so that will be a fun situation for you", "yeah the triples going ideally for me thank goodness", "did you actually hear from someone that a juggernaut is happening or did you just get that from reading the board", "just a hunch from reading the board", "because if i move into rum thinking turkey will support and they dont and move into gre instead then i am in bad shape", "but if the move works then russia doesnt get a build", "can you try and approach turkey and get some info not sure if theyd believe youre attempting an attack on me but it could work", "ive done so but they have yet to respond", "tight lipped this whole group", "how frustrating", "incredibly", "yeah hearing from turkey that italy doesnt love me either so i have to watch out for that", "he told me not to trust you but i dont know how you would really attack me so", "turkeys trying to push you away from those who might come to your aid earnestly if he hasnt mentioned russia then thats more evidence that the two of them are cooperating", "makes sense ill probably have to play conservatively", "god im a fucking idiot ugh i accidentally sent a message intended for the english to the french and the way its worded makes me look sus as fuck", "worst case scenario here is that this is literally the turning point where all my planning goes down the drain and the two who were about to fuckin duke it out turn into an entente fuck fuck", "thats not good im sorry man england and i just started talking anything you would want me to sayget from him", "", "nothing much i already got pretty much everything i need out of them", "though if you could unsuspiciously ask them if they have some kind of plan regarding france or i thatd be very useful", "ok so i think the french might just think im an idiot now which is a far better outcome than i could have possibly hoped for all things considered if anything thats better than the status quo before because they wont think im smart enough to betray them competently", "russia just confirmed its a juggernaut", "thats unfortunate", "thank you for checking on that ill poke around with england", "ill be mobilizing forces east hopefully the russians will be too busy with me to keep the turks alive", "hopefully italy stays with me", "theyd have to be fools not to", "yeah ive talked with him a little and he agrees that a strong turkey will eventually be bad for him", "good hopefully hell maintain that opinion", "howd you swindle the russians into staying put this time", "i didnt know theyd do that never asked them to", "glad i guessed right on turkey hes still acting like we could be allies and is apologizing for not notifying me of his change of plans he told me that he didnt support me into rum because russia agreed to bounce in bla again so i wouldnt need the support to bounce so hes claiming to be angry at russia", "thats a good joke that basically confirms it though even if it werent already theyre working together", "yes", "lol especially with that fleet build", "whats the situation out west", "sorry for not responding busy weekend but apparently the british have caught onto my tricks the french and i are allied though the italians should be able to prove distracting enough that france wont be able to roll over me once britains gone though", "whats the plan with you we can effectively guarantee that warsaw falls but i cant hold sweden and vienna is terribly exposed", "also either the russians and turks are doing a more convincing act than i did last game or the juggernaut has fallen apart", "yeah i didnt believe that turkey wanted to go against russia but it looks like he actually does", "not sure about my plan i have to look at the board i will get back to you", "i think i will be able to hold all of my supply centers", "are you gonna support me into gal in order to guarantee that war falls", "wouldnt displacing gal just give the russians vienna for free basically", "i meant support gal into war my bad", "geez ukr into gal", "oh my gosh", "ukr into war final answer", "i was really hoping to secure warsaw for myself truth be told unless you intend to stay friends with the turks once russias finished off but then again im not under any specific threat so i suppose you can have it", "do you want both of mine supporting or is one free to maneuver", "my only reasoning behind you supporting me in is that it guarantees we take it even if he supports it holding with gal they only way for this to 100 work is both of yours supporting me in", "because i cant hit gal this turn i have to cover my own ass", "silesia being the one to move would also render a 100 success rate that fleet in sev cant cut ukraine and prissoa isnt under threat", "prussia", "youre right rough morning for me apparently ill support you in youre doing more of the work", "alright from there moscow is yours ill take st petersburg and sweden and youll take romania and sevastopol as well as of course whatever you can get off the turks", "hopefully it all actually works out that way its gonna be messy over here if me turkey and russia all cant trust each other", "its already messy all over hopefully it ends in our favor", "once again i feel like allying with you is the best move because you talk more than anyone else hahaha", "yeah literally nobody aside from you has responded for like 24 hours", "it makes it very hard to build alliances i realize people have jobs and stuff but still its hard", "yeah not sure what it is", "lmk when you have time to talk", "ive got time right now btw the turks just came to me asking if i was interested in attacking you", "okay hes a confusing player i think i need to trust him short term but keep an eye on him", "well he also just said that if the two of you can get on the same page russias done for so i think he wants to give it another shot", "yeah he does may have been reaching out to you because he is iffy on me", "hes worried about you and france", "i mean shit im worried about me and france too our position as friends is tenuous at best if you ask me", "", "and they barely fuckin talk", "i need to know if im moving into the north sea or not damnit", "what is your stance on me taking war", "like how opposed are you because i understand that you could risk it and try and just take it your self", "im not terribly opposed but me taking it would have us in better position to take moscow if you ask me assuming that ukraine isnt displaced", "thats true to be honest my reasoning is that turkey is freaking out about you and if i support you in i might lose him for good for that reason he wants me to cut support in sev so that he can take rum or attack mos to either take that or bounce it i dont wanna do either of those things so i thought if you support me in then you are happy because russia loses a center turkey is happy because you dont gain one and i am happy because i gain one", "however your reason for being happy isnt as convincing as ours", "well the real problem in any case is that if you get too buddy buddy with the turks the italians lose a lot of incentive to be your ally and gain a lot of incentive to hit you while your backs turned", "and the turks honestly dont have more than a tenuous and temporary reason to be your friend either", "totally understand that i dont want to be allied with the turks but warring them and russia at the same time is a pain in the ass im convinced that they are against russia and will help me until they know russia will go down which could very well only be this fall or fall and spring", "yeah once the russians lose warsaw theyre on the ropes and have very little chance of stopping us and the balkans are pretty well tied up in any case as long as the italians remain dedicated", "i am still talking to italy and would have no issues with them attacking turkey i just dont want turkey attacking me as for an italian stab they are now in a position where attacking me is a multi turn process that i would see coming", "true unless they build in venice", "fair still not that worried about italy though i would definitely trust them more than turkey", "same and with france breathing down their necks theyre unlikely to consider treachery", "so what are your final thoughts on my proposal", "if you dont like it you dont need to lie to me but i feel like its a solid compromise", "i would certainly prefer having warsaw myself and eventually i would prefer to get it from you but if you think that itd be better for you to have it i will support that", "i am not against an eventual transfer as long as it would not result in a disband", "of course it would be in a season where youd made gains", "so yes you will support", "i will", "thank you owe you one", "alright the turkishrussian alliance is pretty thoroughly ruined at this point think its safe to double down with the italians to crush them now", "fair thank you for actually sending me into war we might even be able to do a transfer this spring", "though if you told the italians that you were moving on bulgaria they might be understandably miffed to have missed that opportunity", "that would be really nice i could really use the units", "no i didnt tell them that", "ill be able to use my new one to push back russia", "well pushing back russia isnt really the concern anymore theyre going to have to disband the real concern now needs to be curbing the turks before they gain enough momentum on you two", "the russians are all kinds of out of position to boot", "yeah plus they have zero allies", "unless you count the british but they made no attempt to help out this time", "so france is going full split fronts howre you feeling about getting through england", "itll be slow but as soon as russias dispatched properly the british wont be able to stop me hammering through them", "im trying to figure out if i wanna convince italy to lay off of turkey", "alright so warsaw can support do what it likes but helping me into livonia would be pretty ideal", "yeah ill do that but you need to support war holding then with sil", "thats the plan", "what do you think russia will do with gal this turn lol such a wild card", "i could see him movingretreating into boh just to make my life difficult", "my bets that hell pull it back to ukraine try to survive rather than just cause trouble", "hopefully", "im gonna reach out to england about seeing if they would take st p even though it would be selfish and short sighted of him it might be enticing enough for him to do it", "we could already take it away later england is rarely able to hold russian territories", "always", "it would be good intel for france and i as well to see if we can afford to get aggressive with our fleets", "ill let you know if he even responds", "are you hitting bot this turn i think you should", "yeah want to force the russians to have to retreat with the fleet so i can jump into sweden", "okay cool", "any chance you could approach turkey about attacking me once russia is done i dont trust that im not his next expansion target", "i would do the same for you if you would like", "i already have gotten several messages from them asking if im interested in attacking you which is why ive been warning you that they could go after you at any moment and you shouldnt trust them", "how recently", "monday i can check again if youd like but in any case siding with the turks is a suckers bet for you once russias gone they have nowhere to expand and theyre at your back and siding with them will rapidly erode italys willingness to side with you", "interested to see if russia has actually quit", "same turks have yet to respond to me seeing how interested they are in betraying you", "havent talked to me yet either", "do you think taking gre was a bad move", "well you can count on italy not being fans of the move", "turkeys starting to respond their biggest question so far is how we would split you eastwest or northsouth", "i personally wouldnt have done it you need the italians to keep the french off your border and to help if the turks decide to take you down andthe turks have no reason not to want you dead if the opportunity arises you dont need them for russia anymore so who do you need them for what do they need you for furthermore where can they go now to expand", "yeah im just going to have to anticipate the stab honestly i was tired of working with italy he was constantly reading the board poorly saw france coming and mishandled it and other stuff", "alright move into moscow and ill get into warsaw seems like a good time to do the transfer", "just dont support yourself into war because i might not make it into mos", "lol england wants me to attack you", "have the turks support you in and they cant block you also i think england might be desperate lol", "how goes there", "nervous part of the game for me", "not in love with turkeys army build", "have you talked with france about their tyr move", "yeah its an italycentric move they mean you no harm as far as im aware", "they havent been very talkative since friday though so its hard to say", "im assuming youre responding to the france thing and not the turkey thing", "yeah the turkey thing can really only go one way", "he says hes convoying it to apu seems legit and if he moves it to bul instead i will see it coming", "i need to figure out what direction i wanna go now", "not to sound like a broken clock or anything but turkeys got very little option but to fight you at this point thats a pretty good direction to point yourself", "neither of us are in a position for it right now though", "so what are you gonna do you committed a lot of stuff east that isnt very useful anymore", "well probably going to finish off the brits then im not sure honestly", "thats fair do you buy that turkey is moving con to apu", "personally not really but its possible", "my only holdup with it is that he could have just built the army in smy then", "exactly", "gonna see if france is willing to talk will let you know what he says about you", "if he says anything", "he hasnt spoken to me in a while not sure whats up", "yeah im gonna at least try and figure out some italy stuff", "you can take st p but can you hit ukr for me", "can do told you the turks were no good", "glad that i moved against them", "yeah things are about to get reeeeal hectic over there not sure how much i can help", "me either im honestly not sure i can win", "it might be possible if you reconcile with the italians and help them push off the french", "it would at the very least become a lot more likely turkish naval supremacy makes things immensely difficult for you", "im all in on your side here but my navys on the other side of the map and armies can only touch turkey and shore you up if i enter your personal space so to speak", "ya i dont know how much you can do right now", "id be fine with you trying to get into position to be", "what do you need from warsaw", "can you support rum to ukr and can you support mos h", "what kind of win are you thinking you probably wont be able to solo unless you take out france soon", "no idea probably some form of draw but its hard to say who all would be involved at this point", "and yes i can do that", "everything good", "yup yup everythings good over here", "the heck are the turks up to even", "ugh i feel like a jerk putting the knife in frances back this hard feels way worse than what i did to the turks last time", "turkey thought we had an alliance but the last time we talked he said he was attacking me until we figured it out we never talked because i was a little in active i didnt reach out until last night so i had to put in orders against him he trusted me blindly", "france is bummed just sent us a mass message to attack you", "well i hope that you wont that would put a damper on things", "haha yes it would", "there is no way that i can no way turkey doesnt attack me for the rest of the game now", "yeah you really kinda have to get rid if them if you want to go forward with anything else", "good to see that turkey is progressing well if the french disband in tyrolia would you mind if i jump in id like to hasten their demise by denying them venice if possible", "denying who venice", "the french of course", "gotcha", "well moot anyways i suppose theyre staying put it seems how goes turkey", "eh", "i really havent enjoyed this game austria is my least favorite country", "i like austria honestly generally if you lose its very early and it requires good communication", "with any luck the game will be over soon enough anyways the french really have no recourse here", "soon as you take out the turks and the italians we can end it and the turks are definitely on the ropes", "if you had more troops this direction id suggest we could work together to displace tyrolia with one of your armies but youd have to cover trieste and turkey could easily take advantage of that in the current state", "are you saying two way", "unless you can think of anyone else who wed include", "i thought you would go solo", "why would i do that", "lol because you probably can", "i mean i probably could have last time too if i hadnt spent half the game with 6 armies sitting around doing nothing lol", "fair well id be happy to be included", "outstanding prediction on that french move if that wasnt a coincidence", "haha thanks yeah it was a guess", "now i have to guess right again", "if the italians were more enthusiastic revanchists this would be easier i kinda wish you hadnt moved into ionian it really spooked them", "they hate me anyways", "no offense but that is mostly on you", "oh of course", "im terrible with austria i freak out and dont trust anyone", "everyone on the board except you hates me", "cant imagine why the french would but apparantly they want to pick fights with you too now", "for me the problem country is italy can never get the hang of it", "tbf i cant even really talk the british are being extremely uncooperative because of my previous action against them", "i actually like italy as you know i try as hard as i can to ally with russia if i cant get that then usually turkey will attack austria with me", "yeah italys really one where you have to go with the russians or get really unorthodox the generally accepted path is kinda crap", "most italians just start a fight with austria without reaching out to other people thats the issue", "i suppose its another one that requires really good coordination i can never convince the french it isnt worth it though", "as italy", "these games through the study are the only ones i have ever really played where france goes for italy i dont know if its because players are more experienced here or just a coincidence", "not sure ive seen it fairly frequently", "usually france is busy freaking out about eg in my games", "in games im in england and france are generally the ones fucking germany over", "i always feel like that goes poorly for england", "depends if france is the kind of fool that doesnt build fleets", "true", "would you like me to come down and help expel the french i can mobilize munich and warsaw to the task it would involve moving into bohemia and tyrolia but drastic times call for drastic measures", "yeah id appreciate it", "not a good turn for me i made some bad guesses", "no worries ill come down to help out", "so i just realized that my mind made a goof and warsaw doesnt border bohemia would you mind terribly if i moved into galicia to help ensure you can expel the french from there we can mutually bounce in budapest while displacing venice assuming that you dont successfully occupy budapest in spring youll need to hold budapest on your own power for the first turn though", "also if you retreat to the adriatic you can take venice uncontested", "yeah do what you need but obviously we will continue to coordinate", "i feel like im screwed", "well things could certainly be better all things considered", "oh hey everything went great situation normal", "do you think itd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy vienna to deprive the french of the dot or would you be uncomfortable with that you think", "i mean its not mine right now go for it", "if i could get in it would be a different story", "fair enough just wanted to get your approval first", "highly unexpected move from the turks there though it does leave them open to an attack through armenia", "im vacating vienna for you to move in ill be moving to galicia and back to warsaw from there", "yeah you have to because of that french unit hes annoyingly", "incredibly hes sacrificing his ability to hang on to territory in favor of being a thorn in our mutual side", "turkey is getting on my nerves keeps just yelling at me lol", "he says im letting you win honestly all my chips are on us doing a two way i cant stop you so i might as well hope you wanna win together lol", "i sure would love to but at this point im not sure its possible these games are limited to year 10 and thats rapidly approaching i dont think we can make up the lost ground for you even if they all post four noorders turns", "theres basically only two ways for this to finish four way draw and german victory i hate to say it and i wont suggest one over the other to you but i think it should be clear which id greatly prefer", "ya plus i just

either im guessing youll move back to london", "it seems i have no choice what has your communication with france been like", "its been pretty limited made some agreements regarding belgium but aside from that theyve been cagey", "well you youll be getting 3 builds i would appreciate armys over fleets to help go after france if possibe you think thats in the cards", "well be honest with you the

anything gained other than spite by messing with you and that also means i ultimatley die off", "i only ask because your best shot by far if you asked me is if you get me to betray france but at the same time you take a supply center from me so that you keep all your pieces and at the same time throw a wrench in my betrayal so that france and i will be on roughly equal footing while at each

{"messages": ["good afternoon i think its important that you and i come to terms over a few things right here at the start including the fate of belgium and how despite our situation as naturally suited antagonists britain is the larger threat to both of us", "hey germany natural suited antagonists i beg to differ i personally think that over here in the west a francegermany alliance is the strongest preferably taking out england asap what do you think", "i spoke to england and they dont seem like a particularly diplomatic player but im pretty sure i can get into the english channel from there i would like to move to belgium since they will most likely be moving back to london in return for belgium i would be willing to support or convoy you into english territory", "well england hasnt spoken to me just yet so it sounds like perhaps they wont intend to be friendly with me whatsoever i think that your plan sounds pretty solid ill support you into belgium if need be i only say natural antagonists because thats how it frequently goes notwithstanding the strength of the alliance i personally find it quite strong and not nearly as asymmetrical as alliances between either of us and the brits", "taking the english down asap is definitely something on my agenda though one less front line to worry about", "great ill move the the english channel what are you thinking for moves", "mostly just pivoting toward the low countries kiel to denmark and probably to the north sea from there", "sounds good", "so youre headed to belgium now from the channel yes", "that would be ideal its a bit of a gamble but england will probably will think im going to lon it would be greatly appreciated if you supported me in but you dont have to i dont know what else ruh would do though", "eh the english say theyre moving to london no need for the support i need to send some troops over east dont trust the russians", "i dont trust the french not to try to play me for a patsy and youre far more communicative anyways might as well tell you stuff thatll give you the upper hand", "english", "fuckin brain getting words mixed up and making me look sus", "ruhr is moving back to munich to deploy east regardless the russians bouncing the austrians in galicia indicates that theyre going to do a juggernaut and i have to do everything i can to stymie that", "and you really trust england", "they are most likely not telling the truth", "but ok sounds good", "no i dont but i think theyd be idiots to do anything else but if youre really worried i can support you in and keep the pivot to the east for next year", "i would try to get into englands territory with your fleet", "no its fine dont support", "i intend to but i cant leave denmark till its secured without putting myself way out of position for anything in the east if the russians get aggressive you sure you dont want the support", "no of course i want the support as it cant possibly help me and adds an extra layer of protection i just thought you brought up a fair point about russia and its your choice so im not going to argue with you a ton about what you should do", "to be honest i wouldnt be to worried about russia they didnt even move towards you and after hearing what you said i talked with austria and they said they were going to attack russia so i dont think there is an alliance there i would instead invest in capturing english territory which would give you troops to build in your homeland and defend against russia if they choose to attack you", "fair enough ill focus on the english first then", "ok and will you be supporting me into burgundy up to you", "you mean belgium sure nothing better to do for the time being", "yes belgium oops", "well i didnt hit the button to update the orders but it worked out just fine anyways i suppose", "my bad", "yes its fine sooo ig the game is in grace period so i was wondering what you builds were looking like i will build a fleet in bre and if you build a fleet in kiel the 4 combined fleets should be more than enough to take out britain and we shouldnt have to build anything else in that regard", "im building a fleet in kiel most of my armies are going to move east to counter the juggernaut thats actively happening over there but ill dedicate one army and both fleets to dropping the english", "great", "what are you thinking about moves we should coordinate", "moving into helgoland bight probably moving into sweden with britains help while i can still manipulate them into thinking im their friend rather than their foe kill two birds with one stone you know two armies move east", "alright we have a good chance of making it into the north sea if you support helgoland bight into it with both fleets unfortunately it seems the british called my bluff early and the russians have committed to taking sweden so things arent exactly ideal but were still in a pretty definitively winning position", "russians really fucked me up by not bouncing me in sweden good move on their part", "hey germany its a shame russia called your bluff i will support helgoland into nth with both of my fleets we should have a 100 chance of getting in if you attack nwy with sweden and cut support this is the best move for sweden in any scenario as that territory is basically lost and who knows maybe england will move nwy to stp and you will end up getting nwy", "yeah the only worry is that england will move north sea to denmark which would be a damn shame and a pain in my ass", "and if theyre displaced they could retreat there which would just add insult to injury", "ah good point i dont have anything for pic to do do you think i should have eng convoy it over to whales or do you think it would be more useful to support you in", "also would you mind telling italy the following hey italy you probably know i have an alliance with france and they have troops right next to you they told me that they were going to support themselves into piedmont im letting you know because im worried about them getting too strong and stabbing me as they already have 6 centers or something like that just in your own words i want them to think im supporting myself into piedmont", "picardy can stay put for now i think that the english will anticipate us doing something other than trying to take the north sea and will move to prevent it if they think were thinking far enough ahead its worth the gamble that theyll only throw one support at it besides in all likelihood even if you tried to move to wales yorkshire would block it since yorkshire isnt doing anything useful where it is now", "will do cant guarantee theyll believe me though", "sent it along in my own words", "thx mate", "what do you think i should do in the med with italy i could either move lyo to wes hoping to bounce them therewhy i had you send that message and have mar attack pie or i could just support myself in and if they do go to wes ill move my fleet in the english channel down to cover spainportugul", "if you convoyed from spain to tuscany itd be all over for them effectively", "everything worked exactly as planned it seems", "yep", "only worry now is where the brits will retreat to", "im pretty confident they cant retreat to denmark because it was contested this turn", "they cant but they can retreat to ska", "so what do you think would be the best move you think englands going to try to dislodge north sea with all their navies or do you think theyll want to cover edinburgh more", "i really dont know", "i think i will support nth with belgium but convoy pic to whales", "good idea even if we lose north sea thatll get us into the isles then its game over for them", "thats the idea", "ok its a shame we lost the north sea but it was inevitable at least we got whales england should be gone in a few turns and then i can focus all my energy on italy", "if we continue to trust each other communicate and play well i think we have a twoway victory in the bag", "next turn i can support you into nth again and you will definitely get it since i have the army in whales to cut support", "try to suck up as many of russias supply centers as you can they are very weak and seem to be afk", "yeah hopefully if all goes well ill be building quite a lot austrias betrayal of italy in favor of turkey is really telling so i think ill have my hands full on that front soon enough a two way victory sounds splendid to me", "how will we split britain", "um so this turn i think im going to support myself into london but also support you into the nth sea from there you can take edi and i can support you into that", "nah focus on succeeding in london poke north sea with belgium so that it cant support im supporting myself into sweden and moving on norway from there if you want to simplify things we could have you take all of britain and just transfer belgium to me so that we both net 2 from the british since ill have norway though i would understand why you might be uncomfortable with that", "im really torn over what to do in italy i spoke to austria about going after them together and they are thinking about it i could try convoying mar into tuscany with pie supporting this is basically the same as just moving pie into tuscany with support from my fleet except for that if i convoy mar the support is less likely to be cuti think there is a higher chance they will cut support to my fleet than cut supportmove to piedmont", "the austrians are currently making a whole slew of bad decisions allying with the turks is a suckers bet im not sure what you should do tbh the italians arent talking to me much anymore", "i suppose we could have me take all of britain and have me give you belgium but i would ask that as soon as you take belgium you move back out its definitely an option but i will have to think about it", "oh of course once i had it id get out of there immediately trust is the key in transfers like this", "take your time weve got several turns until it needs settling and several days till the next turn", "i could move piedmont to tyr its a great place to be not sure if i would get in though", "tyr is one of those spots where everyone around gets nervous when youre there", "yep austria wouldnt like that", "good tactical utility though if you want to strongarm into venice", "i feel like we could very well end up with a standoff between me and you and turkey and austria im kinda trying to brew unrest over there spreading rumours and such", "i have been desperately attempting to convince the austrians that theyre better off with me but it hasnt been working", "why didnt you want me supporting you my move into lon was already garunteed", "whatever", "i was thinking either the british or russians would make a play for sweden wanted the support to ensure the move in any case we should have an easy time moving forward", "in any case were both making pretty good gains", "ill be building in munich just so i dont catch you by surprise with that want to be able to move in as fast as possible on the austrians when we go for it", "what do you think the next move should be", "could you support bel to nth", "absolutely my fleet in denmark wouldnt be doing anything otherwise are you moving in with piedmont or tyrolia because if its not tyrolia i can support that to stay put just in case the austrians get antsy", "im having tyrolia support piedmont in i will definitly get it unless for some reason the austrians support italy which would be wierd", "thanks for supporting bel", "feel free to support tyr but dont feel pressure to do so if you have a better move in mind", "im waiting to have st petersburg to make a move on the austrians munich has nothing to do for the moment except to support tyrolia", "everything worked out great", "and it looks like the turks and austrians are at each others throats now", "the brits are trying really hard to get me to throw myself against you i mean reeeeeally hard", "lol all i can say is that i hope you dont since we have this game in the bag", "you could use that tell them you will stab me and tell them my movesbut false so that i can get in more easily", "i can probably jump into edinburgh via the norwegian sea this next year no need for the belgium transfer", "lol italy just messaged me and said that austrias build in trieste cannot be anything but a play for venice and then i am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere so i guess they dont understand i already have it they sure are getting desperate", "think i should play along or just tell them about what concede really means and that you cant concede something if your opponent controls it and you have no chance of getting it back", "also what do you think i should do for builds a fleet in brest or an army in paris", "go ahead play along lol should be interesting if i were you id build fleets the enemy from here on out is one on the seas almost exclusively", "k what do you think about builds", "would you be ok with me building army in paris i would send it over to the south east prob", "not sure at least one army might build a navy even though i wont have much use for it anymore", "you can if you want but i think a navy would do a lot to forcing the mediterranean open faster italys a huge traffic jam for armies", "do you still want belgium at this point our borders are like super demiliterized which is pretty nice but at this point i do trust you if you want to have it if you want an center it would prob be better for you to have belgium than enland or do you even want a center since you already have 1 more than me", "well i certainly wouldnt say no youll definitely have an easier time taking the italians than i will bleeding anything from the austrians", "whoa didnt realize we were so close to adjudication what are you thinking for moves", "i dont need support from you anywhere this turn all my units will be making moves at englands centerstaking the medtaking italy", "all i can say is that i really hope you dont betray me since you have some units looking like they could just walk into my supply centers we have such a good run going right now as long as you dont betray me we can definitly get a twoway draw", "i think im gonna move on the austrians take them out while theyre distracted with the turks", "england and italy both are truly desperate to get me to turn on you and even the austrians have thrown some urgings in lol", "lol yes the austrians hate me for staying in triest when i told them i would move italy has been desperatly begging for dmz and england is obviously done", "right and austria cant possibly take me and turkey at the same time", "as long as we keep austria and turkey fighting you can run them down by land and i can apply presure with fleets", "yeah im playing both sides to keep them at each others throats", "great", "for the record i really hate doing crap like this but i told myself right at the start that i needed to gussy up and go for a solo for once in my life i love this game but ironically hate the deception aspect in any case its nothing personal and you were super cool to work with", "tbh i was pretty sure you would do that but for once i wanted to trust somebody in this game bc ive been known to backstab people like crazy your all good imma put up a fight though and try to stop you", "you were cool to work with to", "good luck we did have the two way draw in the bag though", "wow you really are pouring units into my hometown basically leaving austria and turkey alone huh", "i know we did and to be honest ive been super wishy washy about actually going through with this because of that i almost did it last turn i still feel like a jerk doing it", "and yeah as long as theyre at each others throats they arent too much threat unless you pull some silver tongue on them to get a real coalition of the willing going", "silver toung it is its going to be pretty great if i can get them to organize then we can actually win against you and that would be cool well see", "that would be exceptionally interesting i wouldnt have a lot of chance to shore up that flank itdbe a fair and square win in any case good luck and sorry about this again", "your good i almost definitly would have done the same", "i normally dont just because i feel like actually being trustworthy most of the time generally improves the game culture or maybe im just soft and making excuses hard to say lol", "", "well this next turn is going to be weird as hell however it turns out", "an outstanding move on your part by the way the italians and british are not being as enthusiastic of revanchists as i was hoping", "what do you mean outstanding move", "as in which one", "the one where you somehow convinced the english to side with you mostly", "that coalition finally came through maybe just in time as well"], "sender_labels":

bounces either way we keep russia from a build and i net 1 build either way", "that sounds like a great idea serbia will be the mover", "yes", "have you talked with russia much do you think theyre full on trying to attack me", "i could also support you if you want to do it that way then you could get an extra build if it worked", "i think it would be better for you to take rumania than i and my gut tells me that your neigbors are looking to gang up on you thats not good for me since im still stuck in this corner", "which neighbors", "germany", "italy isnt too friendly towards you right now", "and i havent really talked with russia yet", "lets talk 02 lets say you take rumania that will leave serbia and greece open who gets what", "i get serbia you get gre that would leave us at 2 and 2", "that is a fair swap", "okay great ill head into rum then", "well we dont trust each other", "well russia told me that he was going to bounce me in the black sea i figured whats the worst that could happen you bounce him in rumania if i support you in you only get one build so since you said you were cool with me having greece in the long term why not go for it in the short term", "yeah i didnt talk to you about going to greece but this isnt chutes and ladders however were now in really good position to make short work of russia if we work together thoughts", "yeah i would love support into rum how would you eventually wanna divide things", "i get greece and then we split italy also id appreciate a boost into sevastapol but the rest of russia would be yours", "the trick will be getting to italy before france does what would help is if italy would head west towards france thatll leave his back door open for us maybe if you told him that you didnt have any interest in helping against turkey and that he should make a go another direction but then again after bouncing in trieste twice in a row he might not be super interested in working with you", "we arranged bouncing in tri i might be able to convince him since france build that fleet in mar", "which unit do you want supported into rumania", "ill move ser in", "are we still good", "yes", "im cutting sev and supporting serrum i assume since i havent heard anything from russia he thinks hes working with you", "id support yourself to hold in galicia but you might have other designs for your units", "if you think i should then i will", "either that or keep being aggressive", "itd be nice to bounce him in ukraine and force a retreat off the board", "im sorry i didnt trust you everything i was seeing made me feel like you were allied with russia", "hmmm where do we go next", "well i guess my first question is whether or not you still trust me you can ask italy or germany i thought i saw a juggernaut forming and that would have been the end of my game i had to play it safe especially since you switched moves on me last fall", "i understand how you could say the same about me but im in the more vulnerable position", "its possible that you could take rum this turn if russia doesnt defend it they seem like a bit of a wild card so who knows what they will decide to do you could go for that on your own and when you see that i dont attack you this season you might be able to trust me enough to move this forward", "i think i think you have budapest vulnerable id appreciate it if ukr either went for moscow or sevastopol we have to worry about the western triple", "so lets get our armies into russia and counter germany there", "do you think you can get me into sev", "like can you commit bla to supporting me in", "well that fleet is busy attacking rumania i would like a build which i think is fair", "what is serbia doing maybe serbia can support me into rumania", "i think i need to protect my homeland with ser", "but me trusting you after you lied to me thats a tall order im not closed off to it but id like to know if you know what the italian is planning on doing", "i understand that you would want a build but then there is no reason for me to attack sev", "well sev could be supporting gal back to rumania", "well to be completely honest we were gonna attack you because i was convinced that you were allied with russia so i have some stuff to figure out", "i think our first order is deciding what we think russia is gonna do", "i know that it doesnt benefit you any and i think your better move it to go for moscow", "i might be able to convince italy to back up since they have the french to deal with", "i would appreciate that", "game moves tonight at midnight right", "i think that russia is probably on the weaker end of the spectrum i think that he goes defensive", "he might lash out at vienna but it is extremely unlikely that he goes for budapest while you move to vienna", "i think honestly that he supports himself back into rumania and covers moscow", "which is why i was requesting that you go for sevastopol cutting its support", "that would be the smart move he seems irrational though he doesnt really negotiate and is very aggressive", "yes i dont disagree im a little disappointed that you thought i was going to blindly ally with him", "what do you think italy is going to do with a greece", "was he supposed to support you into bulgaria", "he just offered but im explaining to him that you attacked russia last turn he didnt realize", "ive asked him to allow us to go after russia while he gets into a better position against france we need to drive a wedge into this western triple", "ok i now realize that theres no western triple instead its an fg which is just as bad for you guys since germany is already into russia heres my idea and take it or leave it but i suggest that he keep rotating his fleets out maybe move towards wes and tun while you backfill ion he builds a fleet in rom and you convoy him into nap in the spring now hes got three fleets in play while france is trying to land a unit on england meanwhile you move your army out of ser and towards munich and i move bulrum north into sev mos and war its a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the balkans", "im gonna have to think about it because so far germany has been a good friend for me this game", "right and where is he going to go next", "and when you say good friend what supply centers did he help you into", "totally understandable just has been giving good information and stuff right now his plan is to eat france after england could be a lie but i would believe it", "right with what units", "france has three armies if he gets into england hell get more builds unless youre going to help him get past france in the south hell have armies in france for defense and if youre antiitaly then we should be having a totally different conversation", "im not saying that you should sign up 100 for the go after germany party but ive presented you with a fair proposal and it doesnt require you to do anything thats against your interests and if it can clear up your border in the south it can let you access where the dots are which for you is germany", "i gotcha ive gotta eat dinner right now but how late tonight will you be able to chat", "ill be around either on the computer or on my phone", "okay im reading your proposal again and are you saying you would get all of russia", "i now realize what i wrote but i do need an outlet if you want to see me nothing but bottled up and without an outlet for expansion we need to have another kind of conversation", "not without exchanging some of those centers for rumania andor bulgaria", "im also totally down with attacking through italy and pouring fleets into the med but i am under the impression that you want to ally with him and want to find some way to work together with you", "i do not want you bottled up bottled up turkey usually attacks austria", "i agree with that sentiment", "what would your thoughts be if i could get germany to support ukr into war", "i think that would be awesome", "it would be difficult to defend but is the right move for you worry about holding it later get the bulwark against his growth now", "okay well go ahead with that then", "what will happen with serbia and greece", "not sure what would you vote for", "well id prefer it if you didnt cut bulgarias support of an attack on rumania", "of course not i was probably just gonna support gre holding", "if you trust italy not to go after serbia then you could rotate your armies out and probably bounce in oneboth of them", "yeah still figuring that it", "out", "is he sending his fleet to ems or towards france", "well you know which direction id prefer", "im hoping toward france i told him he should", "ive enjoyed speaking with you by the way", "i hope that we can continue to have these kinds of dialogues", "yeah you as well its good to find people that are actually able to negotiate and stuff i hope we can get past our early struggles", "do you play any facetoface", "not much hard to get 7 people together", "where abouts do you live general area im not trying to cyberstalk you", "i go to michigan state", "theres a sizeable hobby in chicago", "but i dont think east lansing is that close", "haha no it is not", "i went to college in cleveland and could never get a game together i did travel to tournaments though theyre a lot of fun as long as you can get over yourself and realize that every game is an opportunity to improve", "how do tournaments work", "three to four more or less random board draws usually you score your best three results there are a few different scoring systems but generally speaking if you get good results youll do well", "seems fun how do the negotiations go like do you pull people aside", "yes usually its in a big room like a hotel ballroom or dormitory basement", "and theres 35 boards going on simultaneously", "so theres about 1030 conversations going simultaneously", "okay so people know who youre talking to that is one thing i like about this is like i could be talking to russia and you wouldnt know it", "obviously im not in this case", "or maybe you are", "hahahaha", "by the way if serbia isnt moving can it support conrum", "its moving", "may i ask where", "bud", "ill trust you on this one", "italy has gotten himself way out of position i know you like him but hes not taking advantage of his opportunity against france and is wide open to attack by us you could go to greece and i could go to rumania and wed have peace id have to hold for a turn so that he doesnt retreat to bulgaria", "yeah lets look at the builds first", "im also a little frustrated with him because he hasnt replied to a single one of my messages in days not that im overloading him but this needs to be a two way conversation i mean thats what were being compensated for", "yeah he hasnt chatted a ton with me either", "", "you around im weighing my build options", "any thoughts fleet versus army", "alright we doing this", "my bad didnt see the notifications", "so obviously youre gonna kick italy out of your area are you gonna take sev this turn", "well id like to coordinate my move with you are you taking greece hed be down to one army and since he doesnt seem interested in defending his dots from france you and i might as well go after them", "honestly i have to decide how much i trust you vs how much faith i have in him because at this point in the game i still need an ally", "id like for you to take sev it we need russia to lose more units so that we can finish him before germany is too strong", "i feel like despite our rocky start you and i have communicated enough that we can declare a full alliance though", "regarding sev id like to take it this year maybe in the fall", "i think we can definitely partner up and work together to both our benefit i also dont think it will be particularly difficult to separate our forces i only have two armies so im not much of a threat to you and you only have one fleet so im not worried about you coming after me by yourself the wild card in all of this is italy and hes only got one fleet over by me and a french unit in piedmont", "right now i have bulgaria supporting serbia into greece ill rotate up the coast towards sevastopol in the fall and well convoy you onto the boot as soon as possible i mean thats a strong position for you", "if we were to follow this sort of path where do you see your expansion going you can get sev tun and nap then what", "also i dont need your support into gre i would rather you took sev this turn", "expansion maybe mos and stp im assuming youre going to head west towards germany in this scenario otherwise this is only a 10 year game i dont have grand designs on a solo victory or anything", "ok i will hold in bulgaria so that italy cant retreat there and ill take out sev youre not dislodging galicia are you im worried about him retreating to rumania", "sounds good i am not dislodging", "ok", "i know youre choosing between working with italy and working with me the path im offering to you allows you to control your own growth and depend on yourself for gains and making it so that our border is unitless the path of working with italy also allows you to grow but youll be depending on someone else for help after the initial gain and youll have to dedicate units to the balkans until im fully eliminated from the game both are legitimate choices but i think my offer is superior based on merit ive demonstrated that im a reliable partner that i make solid moves and do what i say", "yeah i gotcha i just hate playing as austria and dont have a lot of successful experience often due to turkey that and the beginning of this game has made me cautious", "but italys attack on you is uncoordinated with me and not really going anywhere and its hard to work with that", "im curious what your plan is you have a lot of armies on my border", "yeah i gotta move those im sorry i was just playing cautious hopefully russia has actually quit that would make things much easier i will definitely have to go cover tri because italy is in ven and pissed at me", "im moving emsion can you support it in with greece", "eas", "yes", "will you support me into aos", "mos", "i was gonna self bounce in rumania", "is germany kicking you out of warsaw", "no but were trying to transfer it it was a condition of me getting it first", "i cant this year hes got that pesky a galicia", "okay its all good", "hey i wanted to say is it something you need to prevent the loss of a center because if germany is going to start trying to take dots off of you you need help into moscow more than i need to guarantee i dont lose rumania in fact i can just cover rum with bulgaria youre not going to stab me for one dot i certainly hope", "i am not yeah i was gonna make that argument but wait until we got closer to when moves were due", "and yes that would help guarantee that i dont lose one", "so hows that sounding", "ok im down for working together for mutual benefit id appreciate it if you began moving your units away from my dots", "was planning on it", "glad i trusted you i think were past the awkward phase of our relationship", "i hope so now i need to make sure france is just doing what they did to get into ven", "or end around on germany", "that would be a premature stab", "might be his last real chance", "how do you want to proceed can you support ion to hold id like to convoy my army into apulia we can gut italy like a trout if thats what youd like to do otherwise we could look at getting you back into warsaw is germany where you want to head next", "i kinda have to take care of italy first so that front is secured", "ok are you ok with the convoy to apulia", "yeah of course", "or do you want italy all for yourself", "no we could use the help", "are you cool with me displacing the last russian troop so that we dont have to deal with it", "also have you reached out to france about your move", "let me look at the map", "and im not sure its a good idea to tell france what my plans are regarding italy i dont think hes interested in sharing the prize", "i mean sure which unit is going in i can support it", "and you can focus on grabbing stp or getting position on warsaw or munich", "gal is going in", "and france asked me to coordinate so its possible that he would want to with you", "are you coordinating with him id just dislodge tyrolia if he retreats into munich thats a win for you if he takes venice well get you in there in the fall", "not really coordinating no", "ok cool i dont really need to know and ill find out in two hours but im wondering if youll have two units on venice in the fall giving us three", "im still not sure", "ughhh this is going to be a slog i guess well be trading centers while germany and france get bigger", "well this will be fun", "unnecessary though", "your call", "because its highly unlikely france will get to me before germany comes for you", "when you wish washed on venice and suggested collaboration with france i changed all my orders", "i only did it because i didnt trust you i would have trusted you if you had built that army in smy", "ok you never once said anything to me bout it", "didnt want you to be on to me knowing", "im sad because it feels like i lost a friend i really enjoyed talking and strategizing with you", "we really couldnt trust each other we both stabbed on the same turn twice", "what other stab are you referring to fall 01 because i think its impossible to stab someone in 01", "probably what im talking about it how is it impossible we both went back on an agreement", "1901 is the feeling out year", "id have to look back and see what year im thinking of but does it really matter", "ok so heres the thing one of two things is going to happen germany is going to come after you unlikely or germany is going to pour into france much more likely", "but with either scenario im not sure how productive a land war with me is going to be for your long term survival", "agreed i honestly dont think i can win this game", "well neither of us is going to solo in 6 years", "germany could", "all he needs is moscow and one of your centersmarseilles because he has fleet superiority in the north and italy just took a unit off the board", "not probable but possible but it makes sense hes giving me the hard sell to attack you and offering all sorts of long term assistance", "yeah i think hes gonna solo unless france attacks him", "france cant attack him", "what is france going to attack him with", "im not saying like this season", "i mean literally what is he going to attack him with", "his fleets", "wow yeah he does have way too many fleets", "look were not so stuck fighting each other i think we both can admit that neither of us is going to win this game but id really prefer not to lose the game to a solo", "so what do you propose", "that we get you into warsaw", "im being 100 serious my orders right now are for a full scale attack on you but im willing to change them to be cooperative if i feel like youre being honest with me and are actually open to working together i also dont need to get a dot right now and am willing for you to gain if its off of germany", "i will change sev to supporting mos to hold ukr will support rumgal and i suggest you try to get into boh so that you can cut sils support of war to hold", "i could be wrong and germany could not go after france and instead go after you full bore if he does these are exactly the orders you need to use anyway but this prevents the solo by germany which he could get if you and i fight it would be close but france is totally incompetent and does not have the units to mount an actual defense if france had build an army in paris this would be a totally different conversation but he built a fleet in brest", "you could also take advantage of the situation to reposition your fleet to threaten venice and take advantage of the frenchgerman situation but thats your call id appreciate it if you didnt try to take advantage of this situation and come at me full bore but even if you did come at me strong im not sure you gain much", "and you would risk a lot by exposing your back to germany because if you do come after me you can be damn sure im helping him into moscow and anywhere else i can", "yeah ill try and come up with the best moves for me i would be willing to try and work with you because even if youre lying to me i was gonna lose anyways", "im hoping you realize that as well", "we have time before the next orders are due", "germany is asking for support into moscow", "so he might be setting up for a move into galicia hes not really being open about his moves", "interesting", "so what do you want to do", "good morning", "okay im sorry i havent been around you able to talk", "what lies were you going to waste my time with on a sunday evening", "none you told me that you currently had an all out attack planned on me until we talked and then we were never able to talk", "i admit that it was kind of my fault we never talked but i couldnt have faith that you changed your orders since we hadnt talked", "go after warsaw ill build fleets and dmz our borders harass me and ill be a headache for you", "im disappointed in you not in your moves but that youve being compensated to communicate with other players and youre apparently comfortable taking money for something and not doing it that speaks volumes about you", "i literally told you my orders you chose to ignore them", "that seems a bit dramatic", "im interested to see if germany can solo here itll be close", "i mean i still would acknowledge that we should not fight if we want any chance at winning", "but are we ever gonna trust each other", "you never stopped lying to me show me the good faith moves you never actually made and ill leave you to fight off germany but i know that youre just bullshitting me in order to marginally improve your position against me", "i know man im honestly sorry", "i hate austria and am terrible at playing it i cant ever trust anyone and freak out every time i play as them ive been a dick this game because of it", "i see i see that you cant help yourself go after germany stop coming after me", "i dont know what that means", "enjoy your disband you should have taken the free dots in warsaw and moscow", "would you mind keeping germany from getting a solo", "planning on it", "good luck cant see how hed stop you im going to continue a defensive play your commitment to the antiturkey strategy is impressive", "youre so full of it", "you have plenty of easy centers and you still relentlessly attack me", "if youre going to throw the solo be definitive about it support him into your own centers and be done with it or have a if you dont do x ill do y where why is throw the solo", "but be rational im not going to just give you my dots", "i truthfully dont think that he is going to solo", "i will stop attacking you if you move on warsaw and vienna", "moscow is his 18th", "fuck it yeah ill attack him believe me if you want i know you have issues with it and i dont blame you", "ive felt for a while that your best possible result was peace with italy and me to stop germany so i want to believe you i wont attack you any more", "im supporting myself to hold i ask that you play defense", "and grab a german dot", "you can take sev", "i think i have to can you support me into ukr and support italy into tyrol", "i cant support you but i can support him", "why cant you support me what else would a warsaw be doing", "nicely done nicely nicely done", "the key to not losing to the solo is assuming the loss of portugal which is two coin flips not losing 2 of the 3 russian centers youre going to lose stp the question then becomes how to we preserve warsaw my recommendation is a vie s tyr boh a war ukr a stp mos a bud gal i tyr boh i tri tyr i ven pie i tus s ven pie t sev ukr t rum s war ukr t ank sev convoy this plan destroys ukr or ensures that we control it it places units in places that they can cut supports on warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we dont chances are if stp is dislodged it will be able to retreat to lvn worst case is that germany just rotates his armies north supporting himself into lvn and getting three on warsaw lvn pru and sil but well either be in moscow or galicia probably both and ukraine well also have two on munich and he can either keep munich or go after warsaw the other option is to support ourselves into galicia and ukraine im willing to do as you suggest", "i like your first plan with the moves all laid out", "sorry for taking so long", "i should have supported you into ukraine", "it is what it is", "i flipped a coin it was wasnt an effort to weaken you"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true,
