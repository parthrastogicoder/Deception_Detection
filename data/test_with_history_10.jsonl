clever ie let one of us take bla in spring 01 so we move super fast since this game is a short only 1910 and b low stakes helping train our future ai overlords", "could do the slingshot where you trust me to convoy across and crush your fleet parked in rum so you rebuild up north or we could do the i trust you and let you take bla while i go to get to aeg quickly or even the we both trust each other where we trade con for sev while your fleet gets out into the med to actually be useful", "i obviously would feel the most comfortable with the option of you trusting me lol", "im a super loyal ally but i always am weary of a stab", "yeah but if we take risks and build some trust right away in 1901 we can just roll but im flexible", "yeah thats totally true", "perhaps we dive in with the we both trust each other option", "im game i usually do that with you in bla ukr probably bounce in gal but if you can trick a into letting you in yay me in con bul arm then fall we make sure we get your

like a great plan to me", "the real fun is how we play it in our negotiations with everyone else the fun way is we keep a totally straight face and are all how dare he take bla i knew i had to go to arm just in case ok im telling turkey that im taking rum with bla and i think hes falling for it etc nobody falls for it but it can be fun to try and convince them", "lol yeah for sure", "we need to make sure we keep each other posted on what we say to who", "so we keep our stories straight and dont set off any false alarms", "this is going to be so much fun", "agreed on all points", "what do you recommend for my first moveset", "also diplomatically we should be hoping italy does not ally with austria", "obviously an ai would be extra annoying for me and italy diving right aggressively into

entirely a lie and ostensibly proaustrian which means when they see my first moves it wont be a surprise and may trust me for another season or so as we move the plan forward i havent heard back from italy yet youre the one most likely to be able to convince italy to attack austria out of the gate hey lets divide the east work together we kill austria first turkey next etc theyre less likely to listen to me", "makes sense", "ill reach out to italy and keep you posted", "sounds good and if austria is wary and wants a bounce in gal thats ok too if you tell italy therell be a bounce in gal that gives them the opening they need to do ventri or ventrl romven", "smooooth", "obviously im going to be blowing all trust with austria on the first season", "does that really matter at all", "were basically betting the juggernaut makes quick work of him", "it depends if they say i dont trust italy im ok not going to gal if you arent then you do blow some trust when you go to gal but at the same time you went to bla austria and i commiserate around how much a dirty rat you are you tell them that you were sure they were lying and sorry i didnt trust you but ill keep attacking turkey watch they think ill park my fleet in rum but ill attack them instead they could fall for it as the moves look pretty weird at first", "if on the other hand austria asks for a bounce in gal youve blown no trust with them at all and attacked me", "by fall when im in sev and youre in con and ukrrum it all depends on where war ended up gal in spring you probably show your cards in the fall with that unit yes

theyre covering tri so if you can convince italy to go ventrl romven austria is in for a very short game and itll also be too late for italy to realize im flooding into the med so thatd of course be ideal", "you get any feel from italy if they were to turn and do pietrl ventri thatd be awesome but i sense more of a pile on france vibe in the west", "so apparently austria is covering tri so if were really doing this going for gal should succeed so that should definitely happen", "you didnt move that kinda blows it hurt you more than me but tbh i was looking forward to doing our clever plan", "we can repair this if you disband that southern fleet as it wont get out into the med quick enough to really be as clever as wed been planning it to be in fact maybe we can turn this to our advantage austria will never see us working together coming now and will get embroiled in an ai war and i swing my army down into the balkans while you retake sev and were back to the races it could work", "are you still in this game", "hey man im so so so so sorry", "i work in politics and ive been overwhelmed with work", "i submitted orders to disband my southern fleet", "so i have you to blame for iowa", "hahah", "yes exactly lol", "not a good negotiating tactic imo p", "hahah so basically", "im probably not going to be as active as i had hoped but i will consistently make whatever move sets you recommend and wont miss another turn", "once again i am so sorry to have dropped the ball here", "its cool well come up with something just a game", "thanks turkey", "and like i said i totally trust you", "so heres a plan given we have to change things a little and requires less of your time italy and austria are at war but eg are working together so we pivot this into a loosely coupled rat alliance austria and i head against italy and you make sure to hold off the north and austria will help if germany comes on land as well i dont think they will france is hard enough and germany taking on france and russia at the same time has a lot of poor historical precedent ill see if i can take rum and let you grab sev back so you can build north but well come up with something",

down to rum so you should go gobstp ukrmos and either hang tight with war or really lock down stp by doing warlvn if you were playing more heavily id suggest the opposite tell england youll not even contest stp if they take it with a fleet instead of an army and instead throw all your armies at germany or go with me into eating austria but that requires actually convincing england to go for it and you dont got time for that shit right now so locking down stp should help if you just want to move the pieces around the board", "done", "moved to lvn to be safe", "thoughts on this turn", "gobstp lvnstp mossev hopefully build f stpnc", "i dont need a build this year you do", "in some sense its a better rt than wed planned if it works", "england wants to help me take sweden should i beleive him", "thanks for sev my friend", "i think yes he could lie but i told him he should work with you there i suggest offering the support but telling him youll naturally have to cover stp in case hes lying then the safe bet is lvn covers stp no northern fleet build and build a war the risky bet is bluff e out of stp leaving it open for a build while you support the attack on swe", "ill play it safe and protect stp", "take what you can get", "if i can get two builds this year ill definitely improve my odds of surviving lol", "well if you think this build is likely you could save sev for next year self bounce lvn and mos in stp and take swe with gob and build a northern fleet maybe south coast to not piss off england then next year you take back sev and build another northern fleet thatd be pretty baller", "why do i need a northern fleet", "because youre the only one in the east who can build them and stp is extremely easy for the west to take and then hold forever", "northern fleets are the only way you and i are over the traditional stalemate line", "so you need them sooner rather than later", "and thus they make you indispensable to any eastern alliance", "makes sense", "how about i just trust england and hold in lyn", "then i get two builds which will help me expand and a northern fleet", "i trust england to want to hurt germany", "that works too", "sweet", "rockin eg war is what we really need", "exactly", "nice work two builds youre back in business", "im pondering filleting austria are you busy fighting germany or are you interested in taking a little part in that with this ai war ive got the position to mostly do it myself but if you had a war and wanted to take part in maybe getting vienna for yourself you could use that to fuel your further expansions while i gobble most of the rest of austria and push through the med", "i could down", "be", "coolio build that northern fleet to keep some northern play and that unit in war and if austria asks just say its because you just took a center from germany and are prepping for what that will clearly lead to and then gal is the direction it should clearly go with the only thing left is timing we both go simultaneously and its curtains for the hapless archduke board situation may even call for a spring stab for position with fall being utterly ruthless", "i walk into bud ser bul you into gal fall move i support you into vie and italy back toward tri while attacking gre and pop from 5 down to 1 or 2", "then i build a turkish armada and even having given italy a build it doesnt help them and youre

germany against england stp s swenwy", "i dont have much of a relationship with either", "but engl helped me with sweden", "so the thing i notice on this board is that you and i are the only ones thinking about alliances everyone else is talking about extremely short term arrangements gunboat with a little bit of talking basically there is no fg alliance its just that theyre both fighting england for now its odd to me im all for dynamic play but you never get anywhere in this game if you only go it alone", "your moves sound fine but just dont treat england as an ally they merely helped you so their attack on holland would lead to an enemy who wasnt simultaneously building another unit", "yeah for sure", "just all things being equal i rather hit the guy who i havent worked with before hahaha", "then maybe f stpsc might have been more useful next build", "sounds good", "f bar h a gal vie a pru ber f swe den a ukr war", "how does this look to you if we play everything right it

remaining powers i think germany is the clear next target for me and italy for you", "then ill be strong enough to push england off the mainland and hit them by sea from the north and france wont be much of a problem the only thing we have to fear is any strong alliances between the remaining players", "position is key you need to get well pushed over the stalemate line and ill be focussing on getting a bit past italy to france in fact hence my new fleets", "makes sense munich is my main goal for next year kie as well ideally", "yep i may be able to help with munich and we may need to balance centers me owning munich longer term helps me agaianst france", "for sure i have no problem with that as long as i keep growing every year", "in the short term its a good hold for me as i cripple germany", "totally agreed", "you may want to just leave vie behind and focus on germany its not like italy could hold it even if they took it vietrl galboh warsil is a continuing brutal charge toward munich", "yeah thats my thought too at this point it isnt worth it in my mind to work something out with italy", "dont worry about them theyll be busy dealing with me", "amen", "heres my current orders a ber kie a gal boh a mos war f nwy s swe f stpsc bot f swe s nwy a vie tyr a war sil", "let me know what you think", "im a bit concerned about leaving vie open", "how about this i will cover vie for you budvie serbud bulser if italy goes to vie well bounce and youre safe if i just walk into your center i have three units on tri for fall to guarantee it and vie will be the mover so you will keep your center in short ive got your back just remember to pay me back later when i need a similar favor", "for sure im pretty comfortable with this alliance the game automatically ends in 1910 so there isnt really enough time for an outright victory but working together we should have enough time to whipe everyone else off the board im down to set it to a two way draw once weve knocked out everyone else", "agreed on all accounts i dont even think we can truly eliminate everyone else but we can try", "if we have to go three way so be it", "as we get further along we can see if other powers need eliminating or if they can make themselves useful while being small enough positioned properly to not be a threat in any way im not focused very much on the draw size i care more about proximity to a win in a more abstract sense than number of remaining players", "makes sense to me", "hey turkey thanks for the bounce in vie", "a ber s sil mun a boh s sil mun f bot bal f nwy h a sil

this winter", "we have to take tri now actually", "im worried england and france worked something out", "vie s budtri plz", "done", "ef are allies now yes", "expect english trouble coming at you like now", "that makes it all the more imperative to knock out italy and germany quickly", "im worried i wont be able to take munich", "yep", "you may not until we have trl", "my hope is that kie or rug will be preoccupied retaking hol", "ruh", "what moves do you recommend", "i desperately need a build this turn to built a northern fleet perhaps even abandoning nwy is a fall back", "lemme look more closely at the board and get back to you after lunch", "deal", "i think you need to stop the nwgbar move by doing nwybar at the same time we need to just give you tri so you can build another northern fleet we can give it back to me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if youre not picking up another build somewhere else", "that makes a world of sense to me thank you so much", "a ber s sil mun a boh s sil mun f bot bal f nwy bar a sil mun f swe s nwy a vie tri a war gal", "updated moves", "also since you probably wont get mun move warpru to make sure it gets to the front lines its not quite as good as sil if you got mun now but you can still shuffle", "what about war gal", "its slow to get to the lines", "that way i can hold vie and take tyr", "pru can also get convoyed to swe", "tru", "lemme think about your idea it may be better", "gonna move swe nwy", "ok looking at the next few seasons wargal is too slow warpru and im giving you tri now for your build but basically right after you should be doing boh s tritrl and youre right smack on where you need to be with all of trl boh sil pru and ber as you do tritrl im following into tri to push on venice and piedmont plus like i said pru also gives you the option of convoy to swe so your fleets are more free to move around while an army garissons your scandinavian holdings and even do balswe attacking den", "a ber s sil mun a boh s sil mun f bot bal f nwy bar a sil mun f swe nwy a vie tri a war pru", "does this look good", "perfect", "oh crap i think i had old orders in there for tri",

smoothly", "what a lucky save", "and two builds will make it easy to pass tri back to you as i love my army north i should take at least den next turn so i wont have to disband", "move", "so i suggest build just the fleet and hold the other for next year in case you need another fleet we have a solid army marching forward already", "meh ill have to look at the board in the morning but my inclination is to take the extra army and if i have to disband it i have to disband it", "but if you dont need to disband it you wont be able to build another fleet if you stay even after losing tri but winning den but yeah lets chat about it after retreats", "yeah youre right just looked at the map holding the build this turn so i can lock up fleet 5 next year seems to be the move", "i feel great about where were at were pushing past the stalemate line", "way past im in wes also which is good as it keeps france from sending fleets to help england", "so suggestions after builds are in swe s balden balden nwynth guarantees den succeeds stpbar making room for that next build i think doing a similar risk with munich might be warranted munkie ber supports that boh s tritrl prusil then you likely pick up kie but lose munich but can easily retake mun in the fall", "oh wow nevermind i didnt realize england already vacated nth must revise thoughts", "let me know who you come up with i submitted a build for a northern fleet and thats it", "so in the north f nwy s stpbar is a lock and protects nwy and keeps england locked out of bar completely with respect to sweden taking den with swe leaves bal in place which is great for taking on protecting kieber however that also brings up another great use of f bal convoys", "f bal c pruden f swe supports it and either a munkie with support from ber or a berkie with boh supporting mun ensures that denmark is captured the only counter to that is something i doubt theyre clever enough for bur ruh s kiemun hol s denkie abandon den in exchange for taking mun and saving the danish army by putting it in kiel", "if you go with munkie then use boh to support tritrl ill cover vie again with bud", "our situation with your vietri centers is tricky once you recapture trl and im in tri we can press on them but as long as we need to worry about protecting vietri from falling into their hands and from falling into my hands unintentionally to keep them out itll slow us down and possibly rob you of the ability to get that last needed northern fleet", "for now im doing the bulserbudvie choochoo train as well as taking adr and moving grealb if you decide to use boh s mun you probably still want tritrl but that unit may get wrecked by ven s trltri ill take back tri in the fall and your army there would have been evaporated in that case but net effect is it wont change your available builds count and if you stay even elsewhere youll still have another f stp to pull out", "my southern army is a short term problem that will resolve itself in the next year or so as you and france potentially crush italy if it must be disbanded and reincarnated as a final northern fleet so be it", "here is what i have set at the moment", "f bal c pru den a ber kie a boh s mun a mun s ber kie f nwy s stpnc bar a pru den f stpnc bar f swe s pru den a tri tyr", "in the long term i would like to hold on to vie which i hope youre comfortable with", "once italy is broken and im hitting england from the north if for whatever reason i lose vie it will be a very easy target for reconquest by a warsaw built army", "let me know what you think of the orders i have submitted and then it you dont mind sending me yours i would appreciate it no need tho", "your orders look fine since tritrl is moving unsupported and italy can counterattack i definitely need to be ready to crush them in tri in the fall we really didnt help outlet position with this mildly entangled mess in austria as for you keeping vienna long term it is all about moving our alliance forward currently you need the builds so i got you into vie and then tri youre fighting three enemies but as you focus on just two and i come into contact with france ill need the builds just as much so well just keep track of where we need those builds to come from as we press forward", "as for moves it may make sense for me to attack tri with support now and if you dislodge retreat to vie which both protects vie and allows you to use that to attack trl", "so i propose a bud s sertri sertri grealb bulgre", "hey turkey you are totally right and i am absolutely happy to shead those builds to you to help you move the ball forward in the south", "very good point", "if i pick up two this turn then i wont need either center i just want that northern fleet haha", "agreed keeping england on the defensive and keeping all of their armies locked up is key the hardest part will be the island and the french home centers but once england starts losing centers theyll crumble", "what if i just move a tri vie", "then you can support me into thr in the fall", "yep that works too", "makes more sense to me", "done", "the only reason to hit trl now is to cut any support trl might give to an attack on mun", "hmmm", "good point", "in that case hitting tyr is the superior move i can still retreat to vie potentially", "yep that was what i was thinking", "lit", "i appreciate running my moves by you working with you this game has taught me a lot and made me a stronger player", "but losing munich in the spring is not a catastrophe retreat to sil and you already have huge pressure on kie to ensure youd get mun back quickly its a small gamble either way", "i agree but i rather not loose ground there", "thanks its been super fun so far i havent played online in years but used to play f2f with the worlds greatest players no exaggeration", "woah thats amazing", "i played a bit in high school and now im getting back into it with this study", "nice", "wow that went really well again", "so im retreating to the gulf of lyon because hey i can that single lone fleet behind enemy lines will wreck havoc on frances ability to concentrate it will take both of their fleets and one of their armies to cover all their bases in spa and mar imagine what youll be able to do once you can slip a single fleet into nao", "you should be able to hold munich with the same kind of moves as this past season berkie boh s mun except this time bal and den can also support the attack on kie while swe s den and bar s nwy", "meanwhile trl can help you hang onto tri while i move out into ven trl s triven adr s triven and i think ill get in which would put you up one for den and you already had one in the bag so you could build a war and f stp", "my moves in italy are going to be some fun guessing games i can convoy from greece to apu or guess that italy will think id do that and try instead to be tricky and dodge past them into naples but are they the sort of person willing to risk a home center on a fall move im guessing not", "nice i could potentially be up 3 if i take kie as well", "heres my move set", "f bal s ber kie f bar s nwy a ber kie a boh s mun

down a peg and we should be dropping italy to 3 with ven", "im still bullish on us having a real shot to sweep the board by 1910 were inching closer to sending them past a total break down point", "in crazy work offsite meetings today on a boat so wont be able to talk much until tonight but your moves look great at a glance i may need to follow on budtri for better position so i can support ven or

once i score my 5th fleet i will be able to gain supremacy in the north", "ill be keeping tri this move to not lose momentum but you should build anyways", "this couldnt have gone much better for us", "and yeah totally fine with you moving into tri you need the builds and i should be getting two anyways", "which is plenty", "wow that did go well", "they really dont know how to work together do they", "yeah frances silence on the western front is stunning", "and its not like they didnt order moves they just ignored helping england", "the only sad thing is you couldve taken nwg which is kinda crazy not that you couldve guessed theyd support nth unnecessarily instead of nwg", "very true do you see a path for me to take it kn 2016 once my fleets break out in the north englands days are numbered", "england will have to disband something which is great", "well youre building f stpnc so you can start sliding nwyska bar s stpnwy and maybe trying to slide sweden somehow then youll have

we can overrun france in no time and at this point if id rather it end in a 3 way victory than a 5 way", "working with france right now will take some pressure of me in the short term and help me put england to bed for good", "so imo if we want things to move faster yes we offer france whatever they want in exchange for them turning on england and at the same time be ready to offer england to help them punish the one who stabbed them france so offer holland to france totally", "lit", "he might move his fleet out of the med", "also any intel on what englands fleets are doing could save me some time in breaking out in the north sea", "but it will be a marriage convenience as soon as the two of them are fighting each other we have no need to hold back we take them both on at the same time", "agreed", "i mean you can still hit france i can be his buddy", "yeah itll be easier for you to take out england if youre playing nice with france for the time being", "you can even tell them darn turkey keeps going after you maybe we should work together against them once we crush england a little so they trust you even more", "as for what england is doing with the fleets theyre not telling me and i know what i would do but i dont know what they would do", "so im letting france take tunis by the way so if you decide to help them with hol theyll get two builds this year just fyi", "one nasty approach is too give france support to take holland in the spring but then follow in and take it from them in the fall and they dont get a build at all and yet have already pissed off england and they cant work together anyways", "any word on how discussions with france went laying off them for a season to see if they take the bait", "he wants to wait to fall for the stab", "sensible", "i updated

pick up too many dots before i get one given the way hol bel edi lon look i use that to take vie to keep us even while the other armies and fleets keep sliding towards portugal", "okay thats fine im thinking of turning on france and taking hol", "once hol falls that whole front will start to crumble rapidly meanwhile next year i can scoop up 2 english supply centres like taking candy from a baby", "yep taking hol means ruh falls which opens up the delicious wines of burgundy", "hahaha exactly and while having england and france fight is great conceptually if this game didnt end in 1910 i think ive already got everything i wanted from that conflight naval control of the north", "and its not like theyll stop fighting frankly england knows hes dead and wants to take france down with him for the stab we are simply obliging his desire", "epic well i will hold off on attacking england for the time being", "yeah if you start with hol and let him keep his fleets through winter hell have them for attacking france all of 1908 and during that year you can snatch some english dots while hes cracking mao for me", "absolutely", "and why stop with just hol i can convoy a den to belgium as well", "oh shit youre right", "lol france just asked me to turn on you", "do you want me to play along or just ignore it", "it might be entertaining to play along be unsure but let him convince you its a good idea it may make him even less likely to see bel coming", "a ber kie a boh s mun a den bel f hel s kie hol a kie hol a mun ruh f nth c den bel f nwg nao f nwy nwg a sil mun f ska nwy", "the juggernaut train just keepsarollin", "bless", "since ber kie will succeed and munruh wont maybe sil will get closer to the action by going to ber and have bohmun and i can support bohmun with trl i already have another unit which can support my attack on pie", "let me know i can use tus for other attacks on lyo if you dont need trl to support bohmun", "i updated sil ber", "i dont think boh mun would work", "i just have boh supporting mun", "and mun attacking ruh is just to help hol i dont think my army is going anywhere", "yeah munruh wont succeed thats true", "", "okay dude really", "im very interested to hear an alternative explainatuon for your moveset", "man i really enjoyed working with you i thought it would be so fun to have a nice game where we work together and score a two way victory", "itll still probably end up that way frankly just seeing england roll over like a sick jellyfish and france continue to hold me off while crumbling to you i figured worst case scenario you still kill the entire west i rule the east you realize youre still closer to gibraltar than i am so yeah i didnt think you were planning to screw me i just looked at the map and saw what if england and france just gave him the win cant i just cover my ass so even if he grows by 4 next year im still ok and seriously watch how it goes even with this move there is nothing i or they can do to stop you from crushing that whole side of the board and in 3 full game years theyll still both be dead", "yeah i guess i mean well played i suppose", "but i am not trying to blow you some lame line do what you gotta do but it the map doesnt change you already have complete domination over the west on your own and i am not jealous you did awesome im just trying to play a little catch up since france opted to just slow me down and let you have england instead of take them out and risk me catching the unawares totally in their right of course", "yeah for sure but if you felt that way you could have asked", "could you please slow down killing them so brutally so i can catch up thatd be some pretty sad shit if i deserved to be doing better id have outplayed frances tactics or convinced them to somehow be somewhere else", "but yeah i could have proposed you west me east and you probably would have set some conditions but been ok with it ive seen how you play", "yeah for sure i would have been happy and willing give you a few of my centers to keep parity", "yeah you have before we both have i guess i figured itd end up that way anyway and its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission as lame as that sounds", "i guess", "so ill totally deserve it if i get stuck in a mere 3way draw when i coulda cruised into a clean 5050 split with a game long ally you can say i told you so and itll be my own damn fault"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

withdrawing from ruh to cover my cp from mao then and potentially get through to italy", "im hoping he stretches himself a little too thin taking my home centers and opens up central europe for us to

me to deploy holland closer to the front", "alright seems good", "will do", "btw if you want to get nwy to stpsc in spring then you could make it just barely in time", "im looking into move den thru scandinavia", "might be faster", "in which case you could leave ruhr where it is", "nah i think im just gonna park the fleet in stpn and then focus on break past the stalemate line in central europe while he over extends himself taking my centers", "so if you can move ruhr that would help", "alright moving ruh", "maybe you can just take mun", "that gets that army to the front instantly and if someone gets a build it should be you", "since you can drop fleets right into the med", "your naval front is gonna be where this is won or lost", "if he can take full control of the med were toast", "i rather have you take mun than keep that army trapped behind our lines all year", "im fine with that too but what will you do with mun", "move it east", "i think the pivotal factor this year is

can you attack mun with support then i retreat to bur i can poke tyr so it cant support an attack to boh maybe", "also t may think longer that we arent working together", "unless you need kie", "yeah

theyre plotting something", "well they definitely are plotting lots of things i covered myself with arm but them taking bla will require some guesswork on my part hopefully i can convince them to just take rum with the fleet", "alright them not responding to me and pushing north makes me think they dont really have any desire to work with me just figured id talk to you to see if we could coordinate so russia isnt able to easily push both fronts", "how did they push north 3 units went south the only northern move they did is stpgob", "from what i can tell russia was worried that austria and i were ganging up on them at least thats what austria tells me and the excuse russia gave for both wargal and sevbla so im game to try and out guess them with you but i think russia is looking for an ally anywhere if you offered an alliance with them real or fake they would probably take it for example if you offered to convoy to den while they drop into bal theyd probably do that setting off an rg war not sure if you want that but you could", "seems like you and germany are already teaming up on france so you can probably keep russia contained in the north without too much effort right", "im not teaming on france also i assumed russia was going to go for norway so im a bit confused with their plan as they havent talked to me other than saying hello", "stpsc cant move to nwy its on the wrong coast as a fleet", "i mean when they were in stp and then they didnt try to go got swe at all", "stp doesnt touch sweden the northern russian fleet can never bother england in the first few years of the game its moves are almost always stpsc gob then gobswe the only time england ever has to worry about russia in 1901 is if they send a mosstp because that unit can threaten nwy", "maybe were misunderstanding each other", "yeah i think we are i was talking about over multiple turns its just weird how russia isnt making any moves for depots in the north and seems to be letting germany just have at it", "russia didnt move because they lost track of time it wasnt intentional im sure i havent heard from them since the spring moves", "okay i wasnt sure if had been some mind gaming or what happened", "no they totally screwed their position by not moving look in the south", "yeah thats why i wasnt sure if they were just playing really passive to try some trick but its pretty obvious now looking at it", "so it looks like while you worked something out with russia to carve germany up youre now reorienting against them you want to coordinate anything with me or am i the enemy", "im completely fine coordinating what are you thinking", "well both of us have only two main competitors left france and russia if we each take on one while the other goes after the other well kinda split the board up but itll be slow if we pick the same enemy itll go faster but well have to leave ourselves a little undefended in the opposite side i go after russia most likely france grows big in the med you go after france russia is breathing down your neck thats my main concern how do i go after russia if i know france will quickly be taking control of italy can we somehow keep france tied down so were free to mostly focus on russia", "wow did france actually stab you in this position doesnt he know you can throw your remaining strength into making sure he dies to spite the stab maybe she thinks there is not enough time in the game for me and russia to eliminate him", "is france spinning you some tale about how they took holland to build fleets to hold me back", "no they havent responded", "ive been backstabbred so i shall in turn backstabbr", "i can ask russia if they will lay off off you for a couple of seasons so you can throw your units against france im sure hell attack you eventually but i could probably get you a two season head start", "yeah i get the feeling im not going to survive much longer anyway but it would be nice to get back at france for their betrayal", "im attacking france with all my strength if you send nthech youll block breech and if you also do nwgnao and edinwg you can maybe take france down with you", "please please please build an army at home to defend for a few more seasons im attacking france and will help you exact your revenge on them just dont give all your centers to russia", "if i can get into spain i will support you to hold in portugal until the end of 1910 so that if we do it right france gets eliminated for stabbing you and you survive with that center plus whatever you can hold in britain which i cant help either way with", "that was my plan if i can take our france ill die in peace", "ill of course be glad to help enact the killing france part of that plan", "so russia is deciding to kill you to save his ass can you bring loneng to help me crush them both", "wallon to watch your back at the same time", "thats was my thoughts", "france will probably crush portugal if i dont help now and you perhaps getting to

go after russia if i know france will quickly be taking control of italy can we somehow keep france tied down so were free to mostly focus on russia", "wow did france actually stab you in this

channel has me worried do you plan to take norway", "yeah i plan on taking norway and wanted my fleet already in the water to move wherever needed i figured at some point we would negotiate who could go for bel or hol while you get the rest of the iberian peninsula", "yeah i was hoping to get a foothold in bel from there i could support eg your new build into hol", "there seems to be some sort of central non aggression pact going based on their movements", "since g decided to stab me im inclined to get back at them", "i think we need to worry about germany getting alot of territory early", "yeah russia is going south same for austria g has a free playing field i dont think we can stop 2 builds for g either", "ill probably reach out to russia and see if we can stop them from getting too crazy in the north", "afk for a bit", "i will also be on and off so might responses may be delayed today and tomorrow", "so what do you want to do with the channel mutual bounce", "so that it looks like were going for each other", "lets see we should plan out 1902 because after that g basically should have completed their atlantikwall and we cant get you in to help me any more", "i need to see what i does im hoping i changes their mind about attacking mar because thats not so easy", "i agree theyre benefiting a lot from neither of us having moved into that spot", "if that goes well i should have an army in bel by fall 1902 or ready to support", "ive got my fleet going for eng", "great lets see how things shake out", "did you reach some agreement with russia", "no they still havent responded to me im not sure why they moved the way they did unless theyre not trying to piss of germany", "how do you feel about next year moving your fleet into pic and i move mine into the eng and one of us can support the other into bel", "i could also go for den and move my fleet into nth to support you as well", "i think r just didnt submit orders", "im cool trying to support you into bel im thinking about how to move so that g gets removed from bur while also being able to support an attack on bel", "i think maybe moving my fleet to mao so that i can take portugal in fall and you can take eng to support an attack on bel could be an option", "im fine with that plan i finally got russia to respond so hopefully well be able to work together to stop germany from the top and i can help you push them back as well", "maybe we can convince austria to push from the other side to put pressure on all sides", "maybe but id think it unlikely", "yeah might be to early for them to start backstabbring", "since italy tried for tri thats gonna be their focus and r is no longer afk so hopefully that will help", "as in keep a busy", "instead of focusing on bel we could put pressure on hol den if you move to hel what do you think", "i was trying to convoy my army into den because im assuming germany is going to try to move their fleet there but i suppose well have two more turns to get them out if i just go hel", "russia is back but theyre still really bad about responding", "what would you achieve by convoying to den", "my army in edi to stop germany from taking it", "btw you can go a nwystp see if r is paying attention haha", "just the threat of that may force r to defend and will allow a nwyswe", "then in fall you have another support for attack on den", "might have to since they are responding at all", "theres a good chance g is sweettalking them and offering swe and an alliance", "i suppose thats always a possibility", "germany responded back to a message i sent a while ago telling me i can have at russia if i let them keep swe so im going to guess theyre probably saying something similar to russia", "are you okay with me moving my fleet into eng", "russia is basically a vassal state of germany as far as i can tell maybe you can try to talk some sense into them im going to plan on moving my fleet into eng this round and see how i can support you from there", "hey did you get my messages im not sure if they got through", "no i didnt get any since you talking about germany sweet talking", "reposting sure i had expected you to move it to eng in spring tbh now without eng to support it will be hard to take bel if g makes the right moves", "i figured since you hadnt said anything you were not thrilled with the idea we can always blame our diplomacy overseer for anything going poorly", "have you tried talking to russia im wondering if only you had issues sending me messages or if it was a larger issue", "i have but i dont think there were issues with the server they were just busy irl", "if you didnt have the emoji show up on your messages or didnt click either or just assume it didnt send", "the more i look at the board the more likely it seems t r are biding their time for r to rebuild and then ally up", "not that it matters for us currently we would still have to crush g asap to get the cp we need to defend against that", "so whats next will you support me into bel", "yeah i think theyre probably going to working together as well yeah ill support you in", "after i push g out of bur i can push for mun while you go for kie or den", "sounds like a solid plan to me", "sounds like a solid plan to me", "alright so ill try to get bel this turn can i get your support for that", "based on russias fleet i think im going to be having some trouble in the north soon", "yeah i saw that", "thanks for the assist by the way", "turkey and russia almost definitely teamed up", "definitely working together whats your plan this season hold or push further im possibly getting backstabbred by russia and making a push for den", "i think den is good g will probably disband fleets you can also just go nwystp on retreat if youre afraid of the stab there ill move the line up to munich for a push next year you can take kie with my support or den with your fleet and i take mun after", "theres a small chance you can just do a holkie since g needs to cover ber from r", "actually if you could do that that would guarantee i can move into the ruhrgebiet", "i can give it a shot", "are you moving bel if not could you support hol in case germany tries a push there", "i was thinking of using bel to support a move into ruh", "can you support a burruh then i can support a hold in hol", "yes i just updated to support bur into ruh", "ok will update", "i negotiated with russia not realizing they were going to easily walk into austria and germany i may have thrown this game my bad", "yeah r t position is very strong now", "could you move eng out to nth or elsewhere im moving bre to mao and mao to wes", "yeah im moving the up to hopefully contest russia", "can you support me moving nth into hol and support kie if possible once i get hol i think i should be pretty good to hold off russia from the north", "i can support hol but im using ruh to push into mun or at least prevent r from doing so", "support a push into hol", "okay also turkey reached out to me about attacking russia together but they wanted to know how i would stop you from taking over the med are you fine with me going for one of your suppy points to make it look like were fighting", "after italy is finished i mean we can coordinate it so that it just looks like im going for it but you can defend it", "just something for the future", "right its possible but there are no convincing moves available at the time so really you could say that youre not in a good position for a stab", "yeah i think they want something later on", "hey it wouldve been much more helpful if you had used kie to attack ber now r has an extra cp for free shouldve spotted that as well", "imo if you are doing a hold it needs to be with good reason", "and den couldnt have been pushed out anyway you couldve also tried moving to swe just in case", "i was expecting russia to make an attack to be honest", "you making a push on mun this turn", "because i get the feeling im about to get wrecked from the north and my best bet is to push through middle with you and cut russia in half", "yes your support would be appreciated", "im moving in with ruh", "done got me just in time", "thanks", "you have any thoughts on moving forward", "i figure trying to push russia out from the middle while i go from the top i can try to support you into mun but i will probably lose kie", "i think its too late for mun now", "bah adjucation at noon hmm", "holland is safe for now but r has some crazy navy built up", "do you have something i can assist with", "just

as it turns out that would be fine with me in this case", "in my neck of the woods we call it carebear play", "speaking of italy theyre the one i havent heard from yet you", "nothing yet", "could be talking to a a lot or just afk for now", "nobody ive talked to has heard from them so im guessing the latter", "unless everyone is screwing with me already which would be typical", "i considered it", "yeah itd be much more fun for all of yall to say oh yeah jeez italy just blabbers on and on oh you havent heard from them how strange", "its fun but i want you to do well so no incentive for me to lie to you", "rockin then lemme know when you do hear from them and itll let me know whether that happened before or after they talked to me", "and ill give you the same info natch", "sure would be nice for me to know if they are back", "nice defense over there its a fun start for france when you see moves to eng bur and mar but even more fun when they are parried off", "you have some not fun guessing games for the fall though i wish you luck in that", "did russia stab you in bla whats your feeling for alliances", "looks like italy and a are friends maybe", "russia told me they wouldnt go i told them i wouldnt go but said id cover my ass looks like i told they truth and they didnt but its not irreparable at present", "ia are friendlyish the romven means austria will be covering tri in fall", "clearly egi coordinated spring", "i am ok with austria ive actually done everything i said to everyone id do fat lot of good thatll do me", "i believe what youre saying but im hoping they will see their initial alliances are no longer in their best interest", "its hard to convince people though", "if i go with a against r it wouldnt help you unfortunately a shows no interest in antiitalian early moves which is sensible if not ideal for you", "thats fine i just kinda need to know how eveyone aligns with g", "because it looks like an amazing game for them from spring", "im trying to convince england that it would be super fun to coordinate the convoyden gobbal move", "but i dont get the impression theyre that creative", "gob you mean let g get swe while convoying into den", "maybe you should play hardball with italy lay off me and if youre my only neighbor who didnt attack me and i go down ill give you my dots to spite them attack me with them and youll get mar and nothing more ever ill make sure of it", "yes thats what i mean", "i love risky plays like that once got sev in 1901 that was fun", "hah nice", "tbf italy has a great position to attack austria", "oh i love the pietrl ventri build a ven combo its great if you can get those all to work in fall", "just need some help from russia get them to tell austria they feel they really have to go to gal again and theyre happy to bounce but they simply cant risk holding in fall", "does a bounce from war help that much", "its irrelevant now since italy did attack austria unfortunately for you your position would be much better had italy attempted mar", "yeah i had considered it but i had to cover my bases", "yep understood", "tricky situation eg finally fighting and you lose bur but you really cant function with just one fleet right", "but luckily for you germany doesnt seem to understand this game is about negotiation and alliances do you think you can count on england to actually work with you", "im not sure but we share a common enemy", "you know you could flip sides on the ia axis and get half of the balkans probably right", "nor do i want my right flank to succumb to austria", "succumb too austria succumb to me six of one half dozen of another no but yes ai war is as fantastic for me as eg war is for you", "i dont see what youre gaining from this long term by letting r build back up they seem intent to not anger g so what then austria or you", "russia just took sweden from germany with english help", "that was a lost cause", "i encouraged that alliance helping break the eg you and russia were so keen to have broken up now england and russia are both mildly antigerman", "sweden was only a lost cause for germany if they fought with england if theyd known how to be an alliance player theyd have been offering to give centers to england to cement their alliance they didnt do that and got stabbed for it", "i dont understand people who play this game like it was gunboat the game is called diplomacy for a reason make friends use those friends to kill everyone off who doesnt have friends try and convince other people to stop being friends with your enemies and eventually kill your friends before they kill you forget the board the dots its about the people", "but yes if i want to win i have to stab a knife into someone gotta break some eggs to make an omelette and all that", "so from your perspective youre worried about seeing austria get too big is that what im hearing or russia what worries you now that eg is probably not a thing for the time being", "i see your assitance with austria but i wouldnt want that to go too far because italys current position is unstable", "yeah italy is ready to get pretty wrecked unless austria or i decide to stop working together", "so you coming to prop italy up or get a piece for yourself we should talk either way", "right im moving into the mediterranean to get a better position for either case", "why did you not support kie and cut munich", "adjucation happened before i could think things through", "bummer i never really get a chance to turn on russia and slow them down if they keep growing so fast i never have an easy chance to stab im doing my best to keep up with them at this point", "im happy to cooperate since they will be 3 on your supply now", "im not quite sure what they would do by now but stab you or defend against a stab given that they have england in the bag", "as long as youre not helping england thats for sure", "thats true but i prefer to win", "is that really likely on this board", "i dont know but id love for us to work together to make sure we both have a shot", "tactically on this board england falls to russia and you cant hold back my fleets without two fleet builds but then you cant hold burgundy on land if russia stabs me before i stab them they have a shot at 18 before 1910 i could stab them but i have much a smaller chance at 18 in time there is no way you can get that big unless you eat england alive from behind before they know whats happening", "i dont really play with the deadline in mind kind of ruins it for me p", "in any case im not just gonna sit here and die a slow death", "sure so pick direction which has a possible good outcome there are two powers on the board capable of totally overrunning your position so the only option is to somehow play them against each other by suggesting to one of the two that youd intentionally make the other one win the game for example and be willing to follow through on it or be willing to think outside the box and throw yourself fully at one power or the other in a last ditch attempt to get as big as you can in the time left this is a game of alliances being willing to sacrifice your position for a chance at either winning or dying in the process is the only shot any of us have", "would you have time to be able to stab england if you had a build from italy and then we could get russia to support you into hol with two builds you could perhaps quickly get to england and kill them fast enough to hold russia back until i stabbed them in the east and you worked to control the west", "i will try to talk to russia and see how it goes i just dont know if i can get a piece of italy without arousing suspicion tunesia", "tunis is now undefended and yes if you were to promise youd use the build you got from that center to attack england id be ok with you taking that id focus on the two remaining italian home centers ive got almost surrounded and would also promise to stop hitting marseille soo you could bring your pie army back home to ensure burgundy is still more safe in case russia wont help you and keeps attacking ruh to get to bur", "but if russia is willing to work with you then yeah you could get two builds and youd be back in this game as youd be able to get to lvplon before russia could", "but if you dont feel comfortable with any of that id understand youve gotta do what you feel safest doing dont even feel like you need to tell me ill do the same either way italy has turtledup pretty good so itll take most of my effort just too crack romnap you can ignore tun or take it your choice", "sounds good ill use the tun build to shore up my defenses with a fleet from bre", "did you come to an arrangement with russia which ended up feeling safe for you to try this game could get to a 121210 three way draw if you can get into position to get lvp and lon with builds from tun and hol i think there enough seasons before fall 1910 to get there still", "we still playing this game", "yeah i thought about that", "well see what happens with russia", "yep i reread my orders and im crushing rome and letting you have tunis to build for the last few game years", "ok so where do you need to see my units to give you the breathing room to eliminate england by the end of 1910 so we can have a 3way draw instead of 4way", "if we can dmz some area between italy and me then that would free up my fleets", "you are in the more precarious position although the game is time limited so the danger isnt quite so great so you make a specific proposal and ill tell you if that is asking too much or is fine as long as you keep your end of the bargain", "if you left it up to me i could say ill park my fleets on italian coasts and leave tys empty but keep ion for defense", "i normally make very specific proposals so theres no ambiguity if you are keeping two fleets in the med to protect tunis then i can offer to park tunis on the coast and do naptys romtys self bounce and iontun to cut your support so you cant do tun s westys to force tys from me but if you have a different specific suggestion im all ears", "so what happens with tys", "f tys parks in tus in this proposal as thats the only space available for it that is not occupied", "i guess given your lack of response you dont like any of my proposals or have any alternative ideas so ill assume youre not going to focus on getting rid of england thats totally reasonable and within your rights but then that means i have no reason to hold back i guess", "i am not attacking you at the moment but i also dont like the proposal", "so do you have another one", "i can withdraw from pie if you withdraw from tys but not to tus", "im not sure how i can make sure you dont attack tys if i pull back without doing a selfbounce in tys and iontun to make sure you dont support an attack on tys if i pull back and you do tun s westys youll get in", "if tus makes you uncomfortable you could stay in pie as protection", "that isnt much of protection since it would be easy to get through", "tbf in the long term you could push through anyway but all i want is some buffer", "yeah i get it i guess we could lock down on position a bit tys s iontun iontun wes s tun tun h and that way i am not in tus and tunis is locked down safely as well i wouldnt be pulling out if tys in that case", "i think thats fair lets go with that", "sounds good ill go set my orders before we run out of time", "yeah time limits", "sorry about lying about tuslyo i just had nothing left to do with those couldnt just leave my units waiting around doing nothing", "so you do realize that both bel and hol can get taken this fall right russia can snap up english centers at their leisure as england isnt bothering to defend anyways", "and while you have no reason to trust me holbel would mean you only lose one of those two and since russia has to do munruh too cut ruh s hol so if you counterattacked bur s ruhmun you could possibly take munich", "seems like you do care about maintaining at least the status quo", "between you and russia that is", "i can see another way in which i can not got steamrolled you need to step up and put some pressure on russia", "i do realize that yes russia growing too big too fast is super dangerous for me", "since you have no reason to trust me watch what i do", "and please cover your ass", "show me some fireworks", "big enough for you", "and did i not tell you about holbel", "youre welcome p", "you did but i wasnt willing to make the first stab", "oh thats why i said watch i do i figured you had to see it to believe it", "so from here what do you plan to do with lyo", "so to be honest tunis isnt something you can safely hold with england still alive and russia on your doorstep so unless you have a better offer ill be using lyo to force access to tunis since i basically loaned it to you in the first place to get builds to attack england", "i see well its true that england is about to fall", "at least this way you can focus on that direction instead of where its a losing battle", "well that was nice of russia to give you munich", "its not something

hell become a problem for us both after that we can hash out the rest of scandanavia and russia as it goes", "alright are we content to let russia take sweden with no contest", "if we put up a fight well have to go for russia right away if we did that what would we do about france", "thats fair im personally proleave sweden to russia but i wanted to doublecheck with you", "what would you like to do against france", "alright well leave it for now i was hoping to get you into brest as soon as possible and then me into paris and then decide from there likely you in iberia and me in marseilles but i dont want to count our chickens before theyre hatched", "alright sounds good", "hey whats the deal with france theyre talking about an alliance between us three to counter russia and italy", "he hasnt told me about that an efgs an interesting proposition but idk what do you think and wdu mean whats his deal", "how do you want to open up there are a lot of options and opportunities", "but he may just have figured we want to move west and tried to throw me off", "i ask because he said he already talked to you about it", "i think im going to go ec to be aggressive on france and take norway", "he also said hes working closely w france", "lets be aggressive with france so we can switch back to russia asap", "hm yeah russia also told me there were murmurs you wanted to attack me", "my only dialogue with russia has been to advocate for the equal sharing of scandinavia ive been told that russia seems to want to commit south", "i suspect that france and russia are both worried about two players moving on them early and may be in an alliance to stretch us out", "if russia does want to commit south it is logical that theyd try to prevent a united northern threat considering that rusfr may be coordinating i am going to play cautiously and refrain from committing east or west", "russia admitted to me that hes in an alliance with france", "he intends to move on you it seems so i dont think hes truly committing south maybe just maintaining a hold either way time will tell", "you told me you were looking to move aggressively against france if we can get russia distracted by turkey especially with austrian help ik the south their alliance wont matter", "i was gonna play aggressive but im going to slow down to protect my expansion i dont want to deprive myself of builds because i spread myself too thin", "im gonna to move to secure norway and maybe place myself to support you in benelux or move against france next turn", "if frs fleet moves to secure spain ill go in", "alright sounds fine with me just let me know of your intentions going forward so i dont end up acting alone seems like russia is focused on the south which is excellent news for a move on france if we could just get austria involved hes playing awfully passive", "what happened with the liverpool to london misorder last turn", "regarding france are you trying to take belgium i would prefer to have it because otherwise you can get 3 builds and myself only 1", "it works on the website i normally play", "im not sure i was under the impression i could move an army into a space that was becoming vacant", "oh i realize now that im a fool and it doesnt border i wasnt paying attention putting down the move", "lol yeah they dont border", "and i hate to be so greedy to open up but im nervous that if i forego a build it opens me up to have russia france or both collapse on me and then were really fucked particularly if france walks into munich ill need both builds badly", "im more than willing to cede territory to you going forward when im better in a position to subdue france or russia depending on what weve decided does that sound alright", "its really funny that you mention france and munich", "it just so happens that ive been talking to france and theyre under the impression that ill bounce you out of denmark if they march into munich", "ah so he is moving into munich while id rather have that scenario not happen", "he may very well test my loyalty and let me try to bounce out of denmark first but he offered to march to munich if i bounced you", "btw have you talked to italy", "my last message doesnt look to have sent correctly so ill repeat", "have you talked to italy they might be helpful soon", "anywho im gonna try to tie up the french fleet and take norway we can talk about territory later", "well how would you like to work this one out", "and he hadnt responded in a while just messaged him again", "alright so how are you looking to move and are you fine letting me have the three builds", "im going nor and ec you can have your 3 builds rn but ill be expecting land later since youre getting two builds on me", "also if france asks you about an alliance we definitely had a convo about a loose 3 way alliance", "alright excellent sounds good well even it out promise that i just want a healthy border around my home centers and a guarantee i can push back france", "oh ok so you and i had a convo about a loose efg", "yeah just in case france tries to check", "right makes sense", "but he attacked me so im moving in", "alright that sounds good do you want me to move into brest", "also what should i go about building", "go for it although hell probably build a fleet there", "oh sorry missed this", "you built a fleet in edinburgh why id think youd want it in london no", "yeah i was thinking london for a long time but i reached the conclusion that i would feel better with a fleet that could serve as a sort of home fleet and i figured london served as a better base for attacks", "im not sure yet if its a good plan but i figured no harming in trying it out", "i suppose so but russia isnt gonna be able to come your way and were supposed to be attack france rn so", "alright can we renegotiate im not sure what france said to sway you was it the three initial builds cuz you can have belgium id just really prefer to knock out france belgium brest and portugal can be yours all i want is paris and italy can take marseilles and spain really we can really negotiate however id just rather not be at odds w you now id figure youd much rather ally w me seeing as france has struck a deal w every nation ive talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three fleets that can easily slip in your back door to my one that you have pinned on land so if you head my way hes gonna walk in your back door i would bet you money what do you say can we strike some sort of deal", "le me know your thoughts", "im sorry mate frances fleets are too big for me to piss him off i wont push past denmark and if you can negotiate peace with him ill respect it", "alright understood", "i mean honestly mate hes gonna attack you either way and the two of us can stop him im not sure why youd back off like that i dont mean to be rude but how much experience do you have with this game", "im saying honestly both cuz its by far the most logical thing to do and hes in great position to do it now that hes advanced and youve completely backed off and cuz its literally what he told me he was going to do", "what makes you say we can push him back if he has deals with everyone", "if you surrender denmark to me i will help you survive frances push i am not going to involve myself in this war for either side without immediately tangible benefits france is a difficult invasion for me and ive spent a lot of time in the north sea with no new land", "he doesnt have actual deals not ones people are intending to follow through on cuz they dont trust him cuz he makes deals w everyone russia doesnt trust him and is way too busy w austria and turkey italy doesnt trust him either and i convinced him to invade the south although hes kind of a mess at the moment i actually dont know if turkey or austria has any sort of deal with france and who is actually free to intervene against us", "im not sure how you can make tangible benefits if you dont involve yourself though honestly and if you help me out well topple france and how can i come attack you honestly france is headed for you as we speak and is trying to sue for peace with me so that he can complete his invasion of you not to mention he has three fleets you just turned your back on please listen to reason here either way id much rather you take belgium can we make that deal", "sorry about the delay im willing to exchange belgium for cooperation against france", "alright sounds good", "how should i move i dont know how to handle his fleets", "well moving out of the channel seriously set you back", "but we can fix this", "if you move to the north atlantic english channel and north sea and your army to wales you can cover your back side and set up a convoy route into france", "hows that sound", "i am not gonna go nor atl bcause i want a fleet in nor but the rest sounds good france wants to move into picardy this turn", "also given how weird the western triangle has been can i ask what youre going to do with your fleet turning to face france leaves me vulnerable in that regard", "oh i honestly dont know yet", "but i start the game w it and built two armies so im not exactly looking for naval dominance"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, false, false, true, true, false, false, true, true, true, true,

plans are yet and if it looks like we are in good position to work together in the fall i can use burgundy to take belgium", "no worries alright i understand the move to burgundy but i think it should be obvious that any move into my territory would be met with aggression update me in the fall of your intentions", "thanks yeah its not that i dont trust you to dmz burgundy but i cant think of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you and italy and still leaves room for us to work together in that sense it leaves me some flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall the truth is that i currently have no intentions and will let my targets pick themselves", "what are your plans in terms of your moves", "it looks like weve already got ourselves a rat ive heard rumors of britain looking to attack me correct me if im wrong but im sure hes roped you in too while on the flipside he keeps trying to convince me to attack you alongside him i think he wants to pit us against each other and use the opportunity to swoop against either or both of us i think we should knock him out while we have the opportunity", "yeah i think you could be right about this what would this look like do you think england will end up taking the channel", "has he contacted you and im not sure i dont think hed be that aggressive right from the start i cant say i know for sure what do you want to do", "england did contact me i might be inclined to take the channel if russia went to st petersburg with an army but at the moment i think it is better to wait and see", "wait and see in terms of how to attack england", "nice opening moves are you going for belgium i was planning to head there from burgundy but it looks like you are in a position to support yourself in anyway", "yeah like i said seems england wouldnt be so thoroughly aggressive for a first move but we should keep an eye out youre right", "thank you yeah id like to take belgium i hope theres no issue with that", "i am concerned over you getting 3 builds and would be a lot more comfortable with that arrangement if you build 2 fleets", "to be honest i havent thought about builds ill build completely contingent on how everyone around me is postured if youre not in position and russias not in a position to attack me considering two fleets is a lot more viable", "now why would you do that my friend bad mistake", "i know it is an aggressive move and i wanted to tell you about it but i couldnt risk not getting the additional build to put down 2 fleets and attack england", "i will be withdrawing from munich immediately if you are willing to help with the assualt i know what this looks like but i promise you will absolutely love my builds", "one more point england proposed a plan to bounce you out of denmark but i knew he was lying about it", "see you couldve gotten those two fleet builds with portugal and spain you dont need the army in paris unless you want to attack me if you dont build your army in paris and only build the fleets well be fine if you build the army in paris its going to mean war", "i can do that for sure though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into england what does this look like more broadly would you be willing to build a fleet in kiel to take the north sea does this mean you are letting me keep munich so i can build a fourth fleet next turn", "also we can get creative with my unit in munich by sending it to tyrolia to attack andor help austria", "i want to make this work to the point of potentially waiving a build so i hope we can figure this out completely realistically speaking i think eg struggles to take out f and ef or fg has a much easier time just considering the distribution of builds thats really important in a game that ends in 1910", "another consideration is that england seems like the type of person to switch sides at a moments notice and there are some concerns regarding whether they can write orders without a misorder given their turn 1 misorder", "i think that the best way to do that is for you to build f kiel and a berlin which i realize is a tough sell but if we do that we can have 5 fleets on englands 3 and quickly roll over him", "no response", "i couldnt waive a build without hearing anything back from you", "it was written and i then changed my orders", "yeah sorry thought i responded", "i cant really do a fleet build", "you understand", "i think we could work together but i definitely need you out of munich and back to burgundy and then out of burgundy from there", "so lets work something out whats the game plan", "why do you seem so determined to go after me i have you at a stalemate that only england can break meaning hell reap the rewards and italy and england are both poorly defended i honestly just want to know the strategic motivation behind it legitimate question im curious what you see that i dont", "ill send brest to english channel and mao to irish sea but i need belgium so that i dont go down a build", "in regards to your question wouldnt you agree that it is not me but you who are committed towards attacking me you built two armies and tried to take picardy not saying we cant recover from that but you left yourself no option to attack or defend against england whereas my 2 fleet builds can be used against england and are in position to do so", "cuz you did what i thought you were gonna do i dont want you taking belgium and i need you out of ruhr which is one of the places i thought youd go and is kinda an aggressive move now im not super interested in giving up belgium to be honest but im not an unreasonable man lets negotiate", "at the end of the day i need a dot whether thats munich or belgium or something else in return id push fleets into irish english and mao which sets up a convoy into wales and i might try to persuade russia to help you keep denmark", "on your end you should probably take the helgoland blight while you still can that will make it especially hard for england to keep attacking you", "if the english fleet gets into denmark and you arent in the helgoland it becomes super easy for england to support themselves into hel and then convoy to kielhollandbelgium etc", "but if you are in the helgoland all of a sudden they have to support denmark to hol", "hold", "alright ill think about the move set and get back to you in the morning", "i dont see why you need a dot", "just disband the troop in ruhr that would have us certainly on peaceful terms", "because youre asking me to use 3 fleets 1 army for a convoy and lose a unit to attack england when youve been super aggressive towards me with your builds and moves im not going to attack england if you arent willing to make any consessions", "ok i understand what youre saying ill think of something amicable for us both when i wake up fr", "did you think of anything just curious", "oh sorry ive been real busy", "hold on", "i mean one thought is to have me take belgium this year and for me to give it to you back next year that way you can build a fleet and i would be out of ruhr as well ruhr to belgium and id use belgium to convoy out", "you still there", "sorry", "yes", "no need to apologise i get that you are busy for labor day weekend just know that i need a real response before the deadline is over if you are serious about actually working things out ill be around for the entire rest of the day", "i think that should be agreeable let me look at the map again", "seems like youve lost interest in this game id be upset if you werent talking to me but the truth is you arent talking to anyone", "if youve lost interest in the game youll still get paid as long as you put in orders or until you get eliminated id be happy to help you with either of those", "if youve lost interest in the game youll still get paid as long as you put in orders or until you get eliminated id be happy to help you with either of those", "the west you me england needs to figure our shit out before the east comes and rapes us", "yeah i agree", "sorry i havent lost interest in the game its just not on conspiracy so i dont think to periodically check this all", "and the moves that got entered were from days ago", "so lets work something out id love for us to stop all the infighting and make an efg happen", "thats what i wanted from the getgo", "juggernauts coming though and regardless of if you are got buffer or not if you let that buffer go down in me and england itll steam roll you just the same", "im thinking you want to move to tyrolia and support ruhr to munich while i swing my fleets back south", "ouch england got you good", "i can help you", "you still around if you dont make a very specific move you will lose 4 supply centers this year no matter what you will be losing at least 2 supply centers its up to you how much you actually want to stay in the game", "how would like to work together though", "hold on and ill respond more in full", "yeah im still here", "well im not actually sure what the orders are going to end up being but what i can tell you are my current moves so that it can help you plan your defense im moving to ruhr and supporting myself to belgium no use in lying about that so ruhrs support whatever it is will be cut", "i think it is safe to assume that munich and holland supports will also be cut", "so my recommendation to you if you want to stay in the game would be to use berlin to support ruhr to kiel", "i tell you this with little risk since if you tell england hell simply change the plan to one without this key vulnerability", "now you have reason to mistrust me but the truth is that i have 3 fleets and only 2 armies i stand to gain the least from continuing to attack you and my largest concern is a turkeyrussia or austriaturkey alliance which is where i plan to put my focus i intend to let england and russia squabble over your supply centers while i move fleets south to help out italy", "and with russia taking munich your survival means that we could coordinate to take it back in the case of a russiaturkey alliance", "so it looks like you really have given up", "i know things are looking bleak but if you are willing to entertain me for a bit i have a plan that might keep you alive and thus get a slice of the 24 pool for survivors", "just to make sure you see it the plan would involve you retreating to tyrolia and capturing an austrian supply center", "whatever the case i highly encourage you to stick it out because that way youll get paid", "so"],

just trying to cause an upset between us", "that was mean", "oh well", "awfully sorry old chap but alls fair in love and war", "i know you and turkey probably have a nice and cozy alliance right now

of us in the east will be elliminated i say we work together to make that someone be turkey", "what do you think", "they told me they are interested in working with me against you and are going to try

you want to do", "i figure theres not much we can do to stop him from pushing in the north unless youre able to stop him from getting those scs yourself im pretty tied up in the south and reckon ill

we stick together we can get through this early game intact whats your read on russia and italy have you heard from them", "havent heard from either of them yet unfortunately", "ah well our biggest issue is keeping russia out of rumania i will see if they have plans to move most units south it sounds like they might be", "russia is planning to take you out as soon as possible and is asking me to help how do you feel about moving against russia as i believe that he will be the biggest threat to the two of us he is really posturing in his communications with me", "sure that makes sense like i said first thing would be to keep russia out of rum whether that be by supporting yours or my army in italy is pretty quiet but what i did hear from him was fairly anti austrian by the way i believe they are probably pretty tight with russia them being natural allies anyway", "well im getting the same sort of stuff from russia that you have they are indicating to me that they will commit south and want to attack you directly with my help i have told them id consider it but know that i am firmly locked in to working together with you looks like our neighbours have made the decision for us really which makes it easy right", "im quite happy to support you going into romania as i can imagine that ill need my forces to fend off italy will you be moving up to bulgaria this turn and go onto romania from there", "ok yes lets do that and i can support you into greece the following year if you dont get it this year", "just confirming that you will support my bul army into rum this season looks like russia is firmly committed south but germany is gifting them sweden and england looks like they wont put up any resistance either so we better not let them take rum as well or theyll be running rampant in no time", "i can confirm that i will definitely be supporting you into romania russia has been trying to sow doubt between us by telling me that you told him that i plan to attack him", "nicely done i reckon weve got russia on the backfoot now", "yes nice one im glad we could sort things out next is to get you into greece then well have secured our front and can go from there russia does have three on rum but we can fend that off together and warsaw for you and moscow for me can be the midterm goal what do you think", "sounds like a plan ill support rum this turn and move down into greece", "ah i didnt see that italy was in greece would have been wise to check the map before sending messages", "haha yeah well we can knock him out of there if you like either in the spring or fall he cant stop it since he built that fleet in rom", "what do you want me to do in regards to russia", "we can support your bud army into gal i think that would be best so i support you into gal and support ser army into greece if it works out for spring i mught be able to get a convoy in in fall but thats probably a next year thing", "yeah okay that works", "hmm we might need to change our plans i think russia is planning to go to sil anyway still on for greece though what are you going to do about tri can you trust italy not to go for it", "yeah i think best to support you into greece in the fall just need to hold in rum this season if you can still support me in rum that would be appreciated", "roger that", "im not sure if going for greece this turn is entirely preferable as italy said they plan to move out and it might be better not to provoke them quite yet", "ok good call", "well looks like italy messed it up anyway thanks for the support looks like i did need it after all what do you want to do this season", "now italy has moved into tyr which we agreed was a dmz so if you could support ser in greece thatd be much appreciated what do you want to do vis a vis russia", "no problem i will support you into greece if you can attack gal to cut the support there and support me in rum that would be great all going well we get one each do you think italy will be getting out of greece though anyway", "actually dont worry about supporting in rum just the hit on gal should do it", "just confirming that you still need my support into greece and can still hit gal for me", "yes for both", "italy claims to be moving out of greece i might need to pull the support im being told that you and russia might be attacking me instead", "meh ill trust you over them ill keep the support locked in if you and russia wanted to take rum you could do it then we would be bogged down for the foreseeable future and that would just help the west we have the jump on the west at this point so ill hope youre still on board for that reason", "russia and i havent been in contact since i first betrayed him may i ask who told you this", "italy was suggesting it more than saying it but they got me a bit paranoid anyway", "now theres something italy was suggesting that he and i go against you", "yeah im not surprised he was also offering me support into serbia we can stick to our guns here and easily take russia and italy ive got the paranoia in check now", "aye russia was also asking me to turn on you but weve got a good thing going here", "russia has asked me to work with him and italy dont know for sure that they are in cahoots yet and suggested that he support me into romania and italy into bulgaria this is of course not possible now that italy had retreated from greece i was wondering perhaps if i should string russia along so that we may know his moves", "you could definitely do that if you like we will know more once we see where russia builds", "i suspect italy and russia would be working together at least at some level they are obvious allies we have the jump on both of them now though", "so i was thinking i would push into ukr this year and then mos depending on how things go i can support you into war and go for mos next year if you can support my rum army to ukr and russia covers war then the ukr army will have to disband also you can perhaps take the adr if you get it we can get ion in the fall what do you think", "done and done supporting rum ukr disrupting boh and hopefully taking adr", "what do you want to do for this one we should probably repeat our fleet moves this time we would get one or the other", "if you can disrupt ukr ill stop boh and see if germany could hit sil and then ill move gal into war which will deprive russia of a build", "ok have locked that in", "might need to shift tack a little bit would love to break through into russia but maybe we need to make ground into italy first", "aye we seem to be in a bit of a stalemate at the moment", "ill come in to the adr so dont go there with your fleet also i will support your army in gal to ukr that might get us somewhere but i guess we will have a new army in war to worry about will check again after the builds", "it wont be worth it you just get to be the second target for russia and italy if you want to turn it around let me know", "although since germany has given gifts to everyone and england has essentially stopped playing this game has deteriorated into pointless territory", "it has gotten rather back and forth", "well youve given up your best ally for well nothing are you going to follow through as russias puppet", "honestly at this point i dont even know fancied a little shake up as the game was getting a bit stale", "yeah i get that if you can convince russia to worry about the main threat france call a truce and you and i can both try and hold france back if not i will obviously just help france take it out for the price of my survival i dont really mind either way", "will see what russia has to say", "russia should be moving to boh and sil you and i should get into ion and tys knock italy out because why not however if russia doesnt move his armies west to boh and sil or he moves mos to ukr it will be pretty obvious that hes just going to take you out", "i do reckon hell try to come after me after i betrayed him at the start", "if you want i can support you into sev up to you", "and now theres support for you into rum if you want it", "aye from serbia if you could", "done", "reckon you could

was wondering for the longest time about you and italys moves i wont tell anyone but is the plan to convoy venice to tunis", "thats freaking awesome if so", "not sure if it is the best plan if russia and turkey are working together the army could be needed more in albania", "by the way any suggestions for me in the north ive been hearing different things from germany and england so im at a bit of a crossroads in terms of who to trust and what to do", "well i found an ally since i think russia will move to silesia to pull some german units away from munich", "i havent heard from england or germany on why they plan to do unfortunately", "no worries hopefully you have things figured out with your neighbors i think turkey is sowing a lot of discord between russia you and italy to his own advantage", "aye he is most likely up to something", "you need a build this turn", "whatever you do dont let turkey take greece and sevastopol", "any updates on your plans regarding turkey", "i will tell you this in the first year russia told me he was working with you against turkey somehow when the orders were read turkey had convinced both you and russia to work with him", "so it seems like turkey has been playing both sides from the start", "im not trying to be super nosy and i apologize in advance if i am coming off that way but for my long term interests it is pretty important that turkey doesnt start explosively growing and wiping out half of the map any chance you and russia can figure things out to recapture rumania from turkey", "russia wont work with me on this unfortunately", "thats too bad is it like he is not responding to you or he flat out refused", "because it is possible that he has been mia for the past few days", "any intel on england or germany", "england is worried about being caught in the middle of you and germany and germany is just happy that weve tied up russia", "cool makes sense it has been very quiet lately which is concerning me greatly", "i think thats just because its the weekend i imagine itll pick back up once orders start going through", "russia was not responding due to the weekend and he said he would be extremely enthusiastic to work with you", "looks like you are in good shape id watch out in case turkey intends to stab you for 2 serbia and greece", "so what are your thoughts on this game right now", "are you attacking italy", "i love to see you working with russia against turkey im assuming a retreat to ukraine with the idea of taking rumania", "by the way what is your plan with the adriatic sea will you be fighting italy", "that was mainly to stop turkey getting a foothold there", "it might work in our favor actually if the plan is to dislodge turkey from the ionian we have a total of 4 fleets to his 3", "looks like ukrainerumania moscow s sevastopol h budapest s serbia h serbia s ukrainerumania galicia s ukrainerumania will guarantee you rumania", "what is your relationship with italy like i thought you two were fighting by bouncing in the adriatic so much", "im happy to help the cause and ive told italy my moves each turn but i still feel like i dont know what the plan is here is there even a plan", "thoughts on moves", "this game is going very well for you you have zero threats and allies all around you you are highly likely to take bulgaria andor greece this year", "we should talk about borders if you can move your fleet from the adriatic to albania it would help you capture greece and id have no problems staying out of tyrolia and trieste if you are willing to do the same", "thoughts", "not sure why italy disbanded ionian but i figure he may have missed the deadline for builds", "we need to move quickly if we still want to get the edge on turkey", "also any thoughts on russia", "im fine with keeping out of tyr and tri to maintain a dmz between us im not 100 sure about russia at the moment i feel as though as soon as turkey is gone he will move against me", "sounds good i agree i would definitely not leave yourself open to being stabbedd by russia if possible", "it looks like you are aiming to take venice meanwhile turkey has a walk into tunis and will only get stronger maybe we should try to cooperate instead of fight", "what gives with the move to trieste", "ngl completely forgot about it being a dmz im not attacking you dw", "ok i can trust that since i think taking the ionian andor albania is a priority for you", "damn i seriously did not intend to take trieste i had figured i would want to stay in venice for the time being with you bordering it with two units and didnt think i would actually end up there", "if there is absolutely anything i can do to help you with my army in trieste its your unit to order", "i guess just pull back to venice", "sure especially if italy keeps piedmont that might be the move i am also happy to help support budapest to hold so that you dont lose it to russia speaking of which i am assuming you are disbanding the adriatic sea it doesnt seem to be very useful since turkey will be able to keep it out of the ionian anyway", "any more thoughts now that builds have been put down", "if you can support a hold in budapest could i take venice for the time being im getting rather weak as it goes", "i feel like you should have kept albania instead of adriatic putting the fleet in venice only moves us backwards", "i cant stop you from moving to venice though i do feel like you are better off putting it on the front lines", "disbanding albania was a mistake ill admit", "i was assuming a move like that meant you might be working with turkey again which would probably be a huge help for you", "darn we werent on the same page last turn but im super glad to see you work with turkey again", "russia is in a really good position to wipe you off the map so i would definitely try to slow him down ill do what i can in the north", "just as a sidenote i noticed you held in budapest but it could have potentially supported serbia to rumania", "sorry the bot was down for a short bit if you support budapest to hold with serbia and turkey cuts rumania youll keep budapest otherwise you probably will lose it to russia", "congrats on keeping budapest", "we can definitely keep pushing back russia", "turkey and russia both told me that they want to eliminate you and england and go for a 3 way draw", "im not sure im very interested in that because we only just started making progress against russia and russiaturkey alliance is always scary and may be able to overpower me in the long run they dont want to give me any of the builds", "would you be willing to support tunis to the ionian sea in the spring also i can give you trieste in the fall in exchange for vienna if thats alright with you", "oh crap you have a disband", "not sure what the best disband is probably either budapest or adriatic", "i think budapestrumania serbia s budapestrumania gives you the highest chances of surviving from russiaturkey onslaught this turn", "and actually serbiaalbania would ensure turkey cannot outflank us", "darn if you had moved budapest to rumania you would have kept serbia gg", "wait wait wait you can retreat serbia to greece", "if you retreat to greece ill support you back into serbia"], "sender_labels": [true, false, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false,

you", "yea sure thanks for cooperating", "awesome no problem", "wait up im assuming im supporting ska into denmark", "im thinking of moving to sil if you could move into hel me you and franc could crush germany", "correct on supporting ska", "i think our alliance with france has great potential", "and north to helgoland", "and im bouncing north sea in ec but i am down to move there next turn", "also i agree with our triple alliance that will be very helpful for everyone", "why would you bounce hel is a much more powerful postition", "im not exactly sure but france proposed it and im rolling with the flow", "", "sorry i really am i hope our alliance can maybe continue i was talking with france and a ton of the stuff didnt match up and i was worried you would attack me i should have let you know as it is clear you only told the truth", "what didnt match up", "stuff like the bounce in english channel", "but what if i move out of norway and let you get it back could that save our alliance", "ok i need to go now but we can talk in the morning", "yeah lets talk then", "hello if you leave nor this turn our alliance will survive for the time being", "again sorry for the stab in hindsight i cant really say it was a mistake even though i feel bad i really needed the build as austria and turkey are running a relentless attack against me i appreciate youre cooperation i fear if we go to war i will be pressured from all sides and will be eliminated but that would probably also end the alliance with you and france and they are looking in a much better position then you right now so i would really like to continue our alliance i will move out of nwy this turn provided you dont take sweden", "if i have norway and denmark i am content", "lovely i have been talking to france and in the interest of keeping you strong to fight austria and turkey i surrender any german centers except denmark to you", "i dont blame you for stabbing me because its reasonable to play aggressively if you think youre cornered that said my movements last turn ought to indicate that youre not cornered so i am hoping we can return to normal relations i am interested in the current fer alliance to counter at and would prefer it survives", "actually i just looked at the map again you can keep nor for now", "id rather you fight at in the east rn and it looks like you do need every single center you can get ill keep denmark but nor is yours", "wow", "thats really nice", "thank you", "np go show those silly southeastern nations whos boss lmao", "i love the spirit", "is it ok with you if i move into scandinavia", "what tile specifically", "lol i meant ska", "i really hope you dont stab me it would probably mean the end of both our nations", "nevermind i wont move into ska wouldnt be a good move anyways ideally i would move into nth and you would move nth to helgoland where we could both attack germany but i realize that you might not trust me enough to do that", "im moving edi into nth and nth into helgo", "i wont stab you if youre peaceful from here on out im chill to be peaceful like i have been", "ok are you ok with me moving to nth", "i will be peaceful would be in my best interests not to be anyways", "by nth you mean north sea right if so dont move there my edi fleet is going into north sea", "to support south", "yes thats what i mean", "wont move there then", "want me to support you from edi to nth", "nothing else for my fleet to do", "sure", "heres a tentative plan for the fall kielberlin bohemiamunich silesia s bohemiamunich burgundyruhr english channel s picardybelgium picardybelgium helgolandholland north sea s helgolandholland", "enlands idea above", "alright thanks", "so i have a very weird proposition for you what are your thoughts on me convoying an army into livonia to help support you defending centers i figure that france will hold the med so its up to you and me to hold and push in the east", "idk that seems like a very precarious position for me to be in if your army is in livonia and although i would like this alliance to last a long time we cant really know whenif our alliance will end and when it does if you have an army in liv", "while i appreciate the offer i just dont think i can trust you with basically the fate of my country depending if you stab me or not", "also just some intel i think italy is a really bad player", "so what do you think about the future of this alliance what happens whenif we are both large superpowers", "thats fair on the livonia idea lol it sounded interesting but id probably decline too", "what makes you say that about italy", "and i am 1000 down to draw this out with fer but if i get stabbed obviously im going to make it my life goal to be insanely inconvenient", "hi can kiel support munich to berlin i would really appreciate it and would support you into a territory sometime", "sounds good homeslice", "sweet im just wondering about all your troops where are they going to go i feel like to only people you are in a good position to attack is me and france which makes this sort of awkward", "lmao ive been talking to france about that going to convoy to italy and see the world a bit", "stabbing either you or france would get me right solidly dead so im not looking to start a right", "lol how are you going to convoy to italy", "i believe you its just you dont have enough fleets to get there trust me i like this alliance too", "just trying to figure out my plans", "i know it sounds dumb france wants me to convoy via my and his fleets", "let me find what move he said he wanted hold up", "he said he can move to ec and mao to convoy me into north africa", "lol ok", "alright how do you wanna split up germany", "btw france doesnt want me to convoy anymore so im not sure what exactly the move is", "ig u get kiel and holland and i get ber and mun", "sounds good to me", "hey sorry about berlin france told me you reneged on something about munich and i didnt want to piss them off hopefully were still chill", "its ok were good any plans for the next turn you having 3 troops stuck in england really sucks", "yeah it blows lol i guess im just gonna sit around on the bright side side even if i pushed out of mainland europe i can just chill", "heres hoping france decides its time to do something", "hey partner is there a way to resolve our current disagreements without violence", "hey im surrendering kiel to you", "hi england sorry i havnt gotten back to you im really sorry i did that and i feel kinda bad since i really like you as a player you were in a really tough predicament there with all youre troop builds and nowhere to put them and as much as would have loved to continue our alliance you can see how tricky the predicament was if the situation allows i would be totally open to something in the future", "good luck", "thanks", "so out of curiosity are you gonna try to take my home centers or can i just ride this one out", "looks like france got me", "lol its kind of looking like that", "yep", "if you can survive a few more years youll be in the draw", "who knows", "anything is possible", "thats what im hoping fori knew i wasnt good enough to win so i just wanted to hang out until the draw lmao", "yea", "but im pretty confident ill make it to 1910 and might be able to get a three way with france and turkey sorry", "no need to apologize my man i respect the hustle i hope you make it", "thanks i hope u do too", "loved our alliance while it lasted btw", "if you move edi to north and i support myself in norway then france wont be able to take norway and they will have one less center", "hey could i ask a small favor of you", "its basically a lost fight but im not going to give up", "england can you do that please", "hello comrade sorry about the delay class has been hectic im down to go out in a blaze of glory ill help you out", "lol thanks", "techically this if you were 100 self interested this would be gud for u 2 since france winning would mean there isnt a draw which you could be in", "", "damn that was stupid of u", "oh well probably wouldnt have mattered anyways"], "sender_labels": [false,

{"messages": ["greetings from the south hope you are doing well wondering if we might be able to build a good relationship do you prefer to bounce in the black sea", "hey just replying to your message on backstabbr happy to work together so will you go to gal and ukr i think we should still bounce in the black sea as it wont be great to make it obvious that we are working together", "hi turkey i would love to have a good relationship between our two great countries are you up for blitzing austria looking forwards to a great game with you russia", "i think we should leave the black sea as a dmz as i would like to 100 ensure i get rum and im worried about austria taking it so if we can agree to leave it as a dmz i can move my fleet to rum", "hmm ok that sounds finemakes sense as long as youre willing to help me take bud within the next couple of years and ill return the favour for vie whats your read on italy in all of this", "he says that he and austria have reached a truce for tyr", "hey so i ended up going to the black sea defensively because of all the info i was getting from austria that you were planning to attack me not sure whether you actually are or whether you had the same sort of information from them that i was planning against you im hoping its the latter as we have a great opportunity to carve up austria given their very passive start they should only get one build so they will be behind", "austria was telling me that you were going to attack me", "wait what", "austria is telling you imma attack you", "i agree w the great opportunity to get them", "alright well that just isnt true i guess they want to try and keep us from becoming allies how about this you take rum with support and i take the black sea i get bla for insurance and you get rum which gives you an extra build i will try for greece and might get it then we will be set up to attack austria", "to be honest i dont really want you to have bla im just not there yet although probably will be eventually so what if i move to rum supporting myself and you can attempt to trick austria to support you into gre", "the ideal would be if i moved into gal this turn which would put tremendous pressure on austria but this would only work if my fleet moved too rum and you supported it", "if your working with austria and betraying me i swear", "your basically for sure my ally now early in the game i was debating an alliance with austria but they seem to be spreading a lot of misinformation and are asking for very unreasonable things i think they still think im allied with them so maybe i could persuade them not to move into rum and then you wouldnt even have to support me if that worked it would be amazing as we would each get a build i would actually get two", "im spreading some rumors about me being allied with austria hoping the news get back to them so dont be alarmed if somebody says something about that to u", "ok i understand your hesitancy over bla yes austria is spreading a lot of misinformation to italy as well as us there are three things here and i can only give up one otherwise im putting myself under way too much risk its either 1 you taking rum by yourself and i wont try and stop it 2 black sea dmz but wed need to bounce it 3 me supporting you into rum whichever one you take i cant give up any of the others i would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the north and austria seemingly coming for me 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will be really valuable", "i would really like a lot of trust between us as our alliance can be insanely powerful im going to take rum and please dont stop me but you dont need to support me either i dont see why you would want bla if not too attack me", "oh man", "well played ig", "", "ah very difficult to work out what was going to happen there after the first season i knew i had to at least not give up the black sea as that would be terrible for me i had to protect it it doesnt mean we have to be in all out war though i just got too paranoid i guess", "mhm", "right", "obviously i can totally trust you right", "im willing to be allies with you", "but i just cant believe that you were protecting yourself by moving to the black see and as for your message before 1 and 2 are just normal things that we would do in an alliance those dont harm you at all 1 you taking rum by yourself and i wont try and stop it 2 black sea dmz but wed need to bounce it 3 me supporting you into rum", "ok so how about i wont attack you in rum if you dont attack me in gal does that sound fair", "that sounds fair to me", "oh it seems i didnt send that message off i guess thats why you went ahead and attacked me in rum", "i think a move into eas could have a lot of potential", "for me", "oops i meant greece so ig ur going to attack me in sev last chance to crush austria", "ok yes lets do it i think they are after me anyway", "ill support you into bud", "great i will support you into sur next turn then", "lol turkey", "i did not have enough time to change my orders plus i didnt know which army to support we needed more time", "ok try again next turn", "i think i will move moscow into war with sil supporting where i could go for austria the following turn", "also i will move ukraine to gal could you support me there", "this is where we need to trust each other i will be leaving mos undefended and i need you not to stab me", "sorry got all this way too late i really have no idea whether youre actually willing to work with me or not at this point but i am open to ideas", "i would like to work with you i realize that you and austria have an alliance against me but so far you guys havent done that muchalthough i will admit you have me anoyed right now you could lie to me tell austria your plans and stab me but i think that the better option for both of us is to work together against austria it seems like they totally trust you and have left many territories undefended currently me and italy have an alliance and together the 3 of us could rip through austrias territory as they arent expecting it", "if you are up for this i think the ideal attack would be aeg gre ion s aeg gre rum ser bul s rum ser con bul sev rum", "this would garuntee you two of austria supply centers unless austria does something very weird i could support myself into gal and attempt to move for vie", "so what do you think up for leaving you austrian ally behind and siding with me our alliance if it works could be a monumental one", "you still around", "im up for this if you can confirm so you want to take back sev though right", "and is italy on board", "italy is on board", "i would like to have sev back yes i would be willing to give you support sometime in a future turn if you let me have sev back", "i would almost think that you are controlling austria and turkey", "your absolutely ridiculous", "you have such a good chance to stab austria and your practically doing nothing against me", "and i think i have lost count of how many times you have stabbed me", "i was honestly ready this time i thought we had more time i needed more time to sort it out with italy i see they didnt support me so luckily i didnt get the moves changed", "mhm", "youve only said that oh how many times", "if i dont hear from you then lets leave this until next year i need confirmation otherwise its too risky", "i told you i needed confirmation otherwise it was too risky i didnt get confirmation from italy and there you go too risky wouldnt have worked", "and you tell me italy is on board and next minute they are asking me to support them into greece", "ok fine you didnt really do any damage to me anyways", "but now we have the whole weekend to work this out", "and ultimatly i dont really care anymore what you do", "but if you attack me again i wont be up for negation anymore", "ok but i cant give up sev not yet anyway way too dangerous move into gal and ill support you into bud in the fall", "youre funny why is giving up sev way too dangerous its not like me having it gives me access to very much of your territory it is russian territory after all you are already a very powerful country and if you do as i suggest moving into gre and serbia you could have nine supply centers if you give me sev i will support you into bud", "so i think the ideal would be something like ion gre aeg s ion gre rum ser bul s rum ser sev rum", "sev is too dangerous because sev to arm together with your ally italy by sea and its basically and i just lost austria as an ally in the shortterm then you have 3 to attack rum with also you think i can hold off you italy and austria at the same time i dont not without sev and not after giving up the ion as youre suggesting also why would i be giving up ion in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally italy to come back at me by sea and i dont know where you get 9 from 6 2 1 7 then youre really going to support me into rum in the fall as well as the 2 i got from austria so you get 1 and i get 3 thats really the deal youre happy with still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into rum in the fall you will be attacking rum with 3 while italy tries to push through by sea it doesnt take a genius to see that next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise its just too easy to see through", "well that was harsh let me just put a few things straight me and italy is not a thing i communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance as i didnt want to be the only one fighting you and austria but if you look at their moves we havent really done any work together we havent even communicated in years if you look at what they have done so far youll see that they are a a very bad player orand b are not at all committed to the game they have basically communicated with nobody havent really attacked anyone and had a good amount of invalid orders at this point it doesnt make any sense for me to communicate with italy since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast an alliance with you would be much better", "if what you say about you and austria not having an alliance anymore is true then it looks like you dont have any friends at all close to you and i know youre feeling very strong right now but you will lose all of that if you dont have a powerful alliance we are both strong countries and a war would basically mean both of us getting put out of the game", "for the record i dont think you can hold off me austria and italy at the same time definitely not and although i have no interest in an alliance with austria they will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose", "also can you read i never suggested sev to arm nor did i ever say i would support you into rum make sure you get the facts straight before you go on a rant like that", "and one last thing if everything happened like i said we should do it you would have 8 6 1serbia 1greece 1bulgaria 1sev but that doesnt mean i only get one have you noticed my units in munich and silesia by any chance i think you were overreacting", "so im still up for an alliance i think it would be in both of our best interests and could be very powerful but you need to stop constantly saying shit likeoh we never really worked it out or oh im sorry it was too close to the adjudication period and then completely running over my ideas as soon as i say them sure they werent 100 ideal or truthful but we can talk and work out the kinks instead of you going on this rant about how bad and unrealistic the plans are", "i know you didnt say anything about sev to arm thats your army im talking about having the potential to move there but more likely you just attack rum and yeah i meant your offer to support me into bud not rum thats what you said you would do but i cant beleive you would do that so dont include it in the offer", "ok probably true", "but you cant know that lol", "so ummm do you want to try to make something work", "sure", "watch me trust you and get burnt looking forward to it", "ill back off and attack italy and you attack austria", "cant give up sev though but youll probably be able to take it anyway", "lol actually i was thinking watch me you and get burnt", "great minds think allike i gues", "so what are our short term plans i still strongly think you should take serbia", "also just letting you know im telling austria that im going to attack you and that i want to make an alliance to attack you just thought i would let you know ofc it isnt true im just trying ot get them to move where i want", "ill just support myself in sev and rum which means you can take gal", "army stp good luck with that one we had a chance vs france but you and austria dont ill have the black sea this year and ill be the turkish turtle for the rest of the game", "lol some of youre own medicine turkey i just cant believe how many times you said you would do something and then you didnt why would me and you have a better chance against france than me and austria and havnt you noticed my alliance well good luck turkey i cant see us doing anything together for the rest of the game if im going to be completely honest", "did you see my moves last season they were exactly as i said thanks though good luck to you too youve got a good chance now to win", "ok now that i look at the moves again ig u didnt do anything you didnt say you would but you didnt do anything that would benifit us lke going for serbia or gre whatever doesnt matter now and who knows if a miricle happened you could turn this game around and win it too", "hey france is getting huge im not suggesting an alliance as it appears nothing works against us but maybe we could set some of our disputes to allow us to focus our energy on trying to prevent france from winning", "if you give me berlin back i can support you into edi", "i will happily do everything in my power to get you berlin back", "wow i couldnt tell you how much that means to me", "lol but i would like to prevent france from winning cant do much though from where i am", "yeh taking med tho", "would b good", "would be great if i could i agree", "i think you will be able to u have 4 fleets and france only has 3", "i will do my best", "gl", "realistically nobody is going to be able to win before 1910 except maybe france has a tiny chance anyways i know that we mutually have absolutly no trust for eachother but i think the most strategic option right now is to put our differences aside and elliminate austria england and go for the 3 way win", "remember the game is hardcapped 1910", "so france has shown a lot of interest with me trying to get me u and them to go for the 3 way which i think is a good idea but if u do want to go for it we will have to be on the lookout because there is a good chance france is lieng and is going to try to go for the solo", "france is on 15 they have won this game easily he only needs three more he could even do it this year nap lon at least get an army into the uk and next year will be done very easily he was also telling me the same thing but if he doesnt go for the win hes crazy ill lock in 3 way draw no problem but this game will be over next year with a french win no matter what we do", "eh", "if austria works with me we can basically take a center from france this turn", "i think we might be able to do", "it", "no other options really", "so i say we keep talking to france about plans for our 3way but then work out something with austria and go against our word to try to draw it", "there arnt really any other options", "sure happy to do whatever throw everything at france because really its our duty not to just give in die fighting can you support ser into tri i wont make any play for sev i should have built another fleet that was dumb", "or get him to support you into tri i wont cut any then you can give him vie back 1 for 1 ill just lose nap and keep that fleet in apu to help vs ven", "yeh just wainting on a message from austria so we can coordinate", "alright let me know what you want me to do im just locking in gre to alb to help with tri

{"messages": ["id love to work with you this game not sure what your thoughts are but in my opinion russia and france are the two countries who are the most natural allies on the board", "hi france i completely agree with you russia and france really are great allies for now we might not have to much to do with eachother but i would love to have an alliance with you how is it looking in the north are you thinking of teaming up with england or germany i would recommend england as an ally as i have heard rumours of germany trying to takey you out looking forwards to a great game russia", "sounds great i took your advice and am working things out with england hopefully we can keep things balanced between them and meet up somewhere in the middle", "them being england and germany", "any thoughts on your south a russiaturkey alliance could work well since i think that austria and italy may be fighting early on", "hmm do you know any more info about that", "unfortunately not turkey has been unwilling to share their plans", "hmm are you still allied with england they did a pretty anti russian move there", "i think englands moves might actually lean more pro russia given that the army move failed and england will have to put a fleet in norway an army in norway would be a lot more antirussian for sure", "that being said i am trying to see if england would be interested in making some antigerman moves which can help get england off of your back", "whats the scoop regarding turkeyaustria looks like everyone made relatively conservative openings", "im with austria going for turkey", "umm well thats not good", "why is that", "obviously not anymore though", "it looks like austria helped turkey against you and turkey stabbed you", "i was actually allies with them both and was going to stab austria but ig not", "yeah", "i wonder if attacking turkey with austria is still on the table given italys position to help with bulgaria andor rumania italy has a highly vested interest in seeing you do well too", "have you and england talked at all about taking denmark from germany", "turkeys builds are looking pretty good for you", "hopefully you both made up", "im not sure if me and turkey are allies anymore if you want you could clear the order with turkey and move munich into tyr where you could help take austria out", "sure if i have a retreat i definitely plan to move there", "by the way ive been spreading misinformation by saying that you will move to silesia just thought id give you a heads up", "darn it looks like turkey is really committed to attacking you which is too bad is austria willing to work with you this might be the best chance you both have of taking rumania so ive strongly suggested to austria that they support galicia to rumania i figure that cutting rumania support is the best chance you have of keeping sev though turkey has it guaranteed if they simply cut ukraine support", "by the way what are your thoughts regarding what you plan to do with sweden", "are you willing to work with austria", "you there still", "do you have information on german or english plans some intel would really help at this point", "hi france i just got back from a long weekend but now i will always be here england wants me to attack germany in denmark and said that you had requested that is that true no idea about germany as they are not responing", "italy seems like they are messing up a lot they had 3 invalid orders so i dont know how strong of an ally they might be", "what about you got any intel", "i would love to work together with austria as i think it would be a very powerful alliance but i fear i cant stop turkey and austria from continuing to attack me also im a little worried about england", "hmm i was under the impression that england would attack denmark and that he wanted you to support him into denmark", "yes but did you request that", "sorry mistyped above i meant england moving into denmark", "well i assumed england would do it anyway because it should be a guaranteed supply center england and i have been talking a lot", "i think if you move to norway youll be better off i didnt ask england to get you to support him i dont think but i did ask england to move to denmark otherwise id worry what else those fleets are up to", "yes me and england are on pretty good terms as well but i really hope they dont attack me what do you think the likelihood of that is i think later in the game an alliance between me you and england could be insanly powerful", "my hope is that england supports himself into denmark", "true", "true", "hmm its honestly really tough to read england i dont think they are going after you but they did mention taking sweden earlier int he game so i might request a bounce in norway or something like that", "so you think i should move to nwy and do you think i should arrange a bounce or use it to stab i dont really want to attack england", "hmm if you dont really want to attack england i would arrange a bounce probably i dont know what norwegian sea is up to but it is probably best if it stays there", "there isnt a ton of time before the deadline so im not sure if england is online or not", "i told england to move from nwg to edinburgh and they agreed in return for me support a move to denmark", "how close are you with england", "sweet that works fine as long as england follows through", "also rn i dont have any things i need w warsaw anywhere you would like me to move it", "i feel like if everything works out our alliance could last a long time and has potential to become very powerful", "i dont actually think im that close to england right now but we talk a lot hes said he will help me against germany and i am somewhat skeptical of whether he will follow through or not", "i dont thing germany has many friends", "if i move to silesia with war i could help you w germany", "id love to see that honestly", "alright hopefully in return for support i could have berlin and you would get the rest of germany", "especially if the three of us work things out you could drop down to the baltic sea and wed be able to split germany very quickly", "that sounds good to me", "right but things might not work out that great if i move into nwy", "haha", "im kinda worried about attacking england since that would mean england austria and turkey all going after me and i dont think i can handle that", "yeah", "i need to go but ill be back in 10 min if you wana keep talking", "sounds good", "heres a thought if were taking down germany it would make sense for you to support england to denmark", "and then england moves north sea to helgoland norwegian sea to north sea and skaggerak to denmark", "unfortunately it seems that england is not online", "do you know which unit england wanted to move to denmark with", "yea i dont want to attack england i think i will support instead", "perfect i agree with your decision after a brief convo with england im a lot less concerned about things because enow the stories are all matching up", "soo you did just talk to england correct cuz i just messaged them and they are for sure online", "yep i did talk to them i think they were having connection issues earlier which is why i thought they were offline", "they say they are bouncing north sea in ec", "checks out we organized a bounce rhere", "wait by ec do you mean the english channel", "yep", "sorry about me moving into norway i was pretty worried they would attack me and some things didnt match up also i really needed the build now i feel bad cuz they were completely honest hopefully england will accept my apology and we can continue our alliance", "honestly the build was worth it i think asutria and turkey are seriously strong together and stopping them will be a lot harder than i first thought", "yes thx for understanding", "turkey is crazy they try to make a deal with me and they betray every time austria wont respond to my messages and basically nobody can help me over there so hopefully i will be able to hold them off and get some extra builds from germany", "i wish italy was a better player then they could help", "anyways i need to go to bed now but talk in the morning", "omfg turkey is ridiculous", "they just said i did not have enough time to change my orders alliance still on", "imma play gullible and just go with it", "god", "sorry for the all the messages", "yeah they are def lying lol", "building warsaw and moscow im assuming", "oh crap you retreated to bohemia", "as much as i love to see you in bohemia i worry you wont be able todefend your homeland effectively", "do you have relations with either rturkey or austria", "whats the deal with norway", "england says the alliance might work if i move out of nwy which i probably will since i cant have another enemy turkey thinks i am very gullible and keeps saying we will attack austria but he is 100 lying austria wont respond to my press i messed up with that retreat imma build in moscow", "damn", "they r letting me keep nwy", "lets hope its not a stab but i dont think it is", "we should coordinate orders i think germany plans to take burgundy so i am currently defending it and imagine any supports it gives will be cut", "can bohemia head to munich to cut munich support though i want to get clever and see if i can get away with this move but it relies on munichs support being cut", "also do you have any reads on england i could move into ska but only if im sure they wont attack", "sure do you want me to go as for as to support my move into munich or do you think sil should head back to war instead", "oops not ska nvm", "hello", "hey", "not a good read on england right now but he told me he wouldnt attack you if that helps", "i would not move silesia to warsaw because you want to make sure ukraine has a valid retreat option", "i dont think a supported move on munich will work right now but thats what id lean towards unless you want to do a tactical pull back with moscowlivonia ukrainemoscow and silesiawarsaw", "nah", "silesia could also go to galicia", "to cut support and hopefully keep ukraine", "rn im having moscow to sev", "with ukraine supporting", "sil to gal", "boh to mun", "sounds pretty good", "im pretending to be in an alliance with turkey and i told them i was moving out of moscow into warsaw so hopefully they will take the bait and move there instead of to gal", "true", "heres a tentative plan for the fall kielberlin bohemiamunich silesia s bohemiamunich burgundyruhr english channel s picardybelgium picardybelgium helgolandholland north sea s helgolandholland", "this guarantees you munich unless something weird like austria moves galicia to silesia", "it guarantees england holland and guarantees me belgium and england already has kiel", "basically germany loses 4 dots in one turb", "and if ukraine goes to warsaw i think youll be well defended and can build since you are picking up munich in st petersburg this way youll be able to defend warsaw and moscow too", "thoughts there may be room for refinements", "sorry gtg to bed talk in morning", "any new thoughts so we dont run too close to the deadline again", "yeh i agree i like your plan", "and ig mos would just move to sev", "bwahahahaha", "im trying to get turkey to work with me if they actually do that would be amazing as first we could crush austria and then i could stab them", "moscow to sev makes sense", "it would be great if turkey did that though i worry turkey might not go for that as my communication this year with him made it seem like turkey was not interested in stabbing austria", "i sent england the orders u sent me btw", "yea all they have done this game is stab me so i would be suprised if they actually didt lie this time", "i feel like turkey might be on board well see soon if he is austria will lose two supply centers if hes not i should be ok", "nice had we known about the german nmr we could have eliminated him this turn that being said this is still good", "what are you thinking for builds it depends on how you feel about england but if you can trust them then a warsaw would make sense", "rn im just laughing at austria and turkey", "turkey had such a good chance to stab austria he could have gotten two of their territories and put them out of the game but instead he continues his war with austria against me and they cant even capture any territories", "idk about england so far they have been completely honest but they just asked me if they could convoy one of their armies into livonia so they could help help defend my centers but i dont think i trust them enough for that", "yeah haha i think you might even have the chance to retake sebastopol next year at this rate", "on second thought you might need the unit in livonia honestly it looks like austria is intent on taking bohemia supporting themselves to silesia to then cut warsaw support to take ukraine and then take moscow its a 3 season maneuver but it honestly is what is going to happen", "i just asked turkey why he isnt stabbing austria he replied that he is playing to solo so i guess his thought is that hell keep austria as a puppet for the entire game and hopefully eek out enough progress to then brutally stab austria on the last turn", "with these kinds of players you kind of have to just hunker down and form coalitions to fight against them and honestly the only reason it is working is italy is just letting them make so much progress in the med", "i am having trouble keeping in contact with italy but what i want to do is work with him closely in the med and put up a lot of fleet pressure in the south", "if you can get in touch with italy it would be awesome to try and convince him to help with that", "k", "we should start planning our moves", "also what are you thinking for the future of our alliance", "for sure it does depend a little bit on english builds but i honestly think that for the short term future we should be applying pressure on austria and turkey until they are forced to fight eachother", "on my side ill be trying to work with italy if italy remains uncooperative i may have to move to attack them", "what are your thoughts though", "i am pretty confident that austria will support bohemia to silesia for that reason i recommend warsaw s silesia h munichberlin kiel s munichberlin burgundymunich", "ill send this to england as well", "thoughts", "the safest way would be something like this warsaw s ukraine moscow s ukraine munich s silesia", "new thought ukrainesevastopol moscow s ukrainesevastopol warsawgalicia silesia s warsawgalicia munichberlin kiel s munichberlin burgundymunich this move set has all of the advantages of both move sets", "ok im here now i know i have said this every time but i think i might have something with turkey", "we are working stuff out rn they said they arnt in an alliance with austria anymore which based off last turns moves is totally plausible", "also what do you think about turkey if you have looked at their moves throughout this games and their alliances basically none it seems evident that either they arnt very committed to the game or they are just bad at it i have communicated with them a few times but they dont really seem interested in talking", "i like youre moves although would burgundy to munich be permanant or just moving through", "also i think you should go to war with italy they are weak play bad and are getting closed in on from all sidesif you attack them try not to let turkey get all their territories and become to strong", "i was thinking that i am waiting for replies from italy and england first though", "ok", "think i should try to play austria and turkey against eachother for rum so i am garunteed to get it if austria attacks", "i am looking to get another build soon to get another fleet on italy so as long as you were taking berlin and it looks like you arent in immediate trouble it would make sense to make the trade as i feel it is a bit more natural but its a bit to early to definitively say", "if you can get them to fight that would be ideal but i am 99 sure turkey is lying", "how so", "im paraphrasing but turkey told me he was not going to attack austria because he wants to eliminate you first", "oof", "ok", "so is england on board w munich to berlin", "also did you see englands builds given their position they are most likely going to turn on one of us and recruit the other to help out pretty soon", "they dont really have anyone to attack but me or you", "also i would really preffer you not move into munich there is a good chance i wont get berlin anyways if england doesnt support", "i havent heard back on the support to berlin yet unfortunately so it might be best to operate on the assumption it will not happen for now", "i am currently not moving to munich but let me know if england talks to you", "ok", "heard anything from england", "youre right they probably intend to attack one of us the builds make it ambiguous to who they plan to fight", "if they do should we work together too take them out the builds of only troops imply a convoy so i think it would wipe most of their opportunities if we took out nth but then again they might not attack us", "i can support norway to north sea", "but i agree with your analysis that they want to convoy out so taking north sea would definitely slow them down a lot", "so do you want me to move to the north sea they are saying that they are going to convoy to italy but that seems implausible", "up to you im happy to hold", "ok sure lets wait one more turn so for england has been true to their word so", "sounds good", "nice job getting austria to turn on turkey", "so just by the board position we have two options 1 take holland and north sea from england this turn i would bounce italy out of munich and you would get a build presumably a fleet in st petersburg 2 we dont attack england since hes been a very reliable ally and commit fully to the attack on italy and turkey this would look like sending all of my fleets south so it would mean losing the option to efficiently attack england later and also potentially leave us open to being stabbed by england", "any thoughts or suggestions", "regarding the austrian retreat from galicia i think it makes sense to retreat to ukraine and take rumania from ukraine that way turkey wont be able to retreat rumania to ukraine", "i sent this to austria as a recommendation and thought id share with you too ukrainerumania moscow s sevastopol h budapest s serbia h serbia s ukrainerumania galicia s ukrainerumania", "silesiawarsaw is necessary as well i think in case austria stabs you", "i dont really want to turn on england but we could", "they told me you told them you didnt want to convoy their troops and they said they didnt know what to do with them", "so what are we doing about munich", "", "france i need a response to get my orders in if you see this in time please move onewo support unit to munich then you might bounce italy but you might get it which would be ok to ig", "sorry for the late response", "i was thinking that in order for my armies to be useful i inevitably need to be moving through munich to get to tyrolia and other key territories anyway so it seems more natural to me to have munich and for you to have berlin there is also the fact that i kind of need a build right now so if we are not attacking england i would like to have munich as you are already picking up berlin and sevastopol", "awesome looks like you have one supply center open for building in st petersburg and one build which works out perfectly", "we need to get you a build this year so you can put a fleet in sevastopol", "wow you got lucky got one of my territories and two of italys", "if were going to abandon our english ally ill build a fleet but if not prob an army", "so england or no", "its now or never i say we should go for it", "i have to say though i really like england as a player so its a lot tougher of a call than im letting on", "i think though that you could get away with building an army and moving it to finland as to not set off any warning signs finland has a lot of advantages including the ability to defend both sweden and norway", "so i would probably build an army in st petersburg even if you are on board with attacking england", "i also do want to wait for builds since i actually might not be able to even attack england due to italy austria and turkey hating my guts", "how are things with austria hearing anything interesting lately", "intial thoughts moscowsevastopol sevastopolukraine galiciabohemia warsawgalicia this achieves a strong position to corner italy as well as potentially bounces with armenia allowing you to build f sevastopol in the winter", "anti english norwaynorth sea berlinkiel munich s berlinkiel ruhrholland belgium s ruhrholland english channel s norwaynorth sea", "this accomplishes the goal of getting you a build in kiel and takes the north sea holland and belgium all in one turn", "if youd like we can probably wait to make this move in the fall so that england will immediately have to pull two units off the board for builds", "im up for doing it this turn or next i will also move stp to finla d", "sounds good lets wait a turn then", "ok i will still move to finland this turn ig hopefuly that doesnt send off any alarms to england though it probably will but i can say something like it doesnt really have anywhere else to go and its just for safety seeing as you attacked berlin last turn or something along those lines", "so if im going to be completly honest heresomething that doesnt often happen in this game im a little bit worried about you getting a few more supply centres and running off with the game you took munich from me and then also two of italys nine supply centres and a good position a little bit disturbing if you can understand and no this doenst mean im calling off our alliance or teaming up with enlandthat would be stupid of me as they are completely stranded so we are both strong countries and could probably get away with a two way win but are you at all interested in that", "true if we do it right a fall stab should be unpreventable even if england does suspect something", "i appreciate you bringing up concerns i would definitely be interested in a twoway win it might be comforting to know that the supply center gap is absolutely temporary as italy and austria will work together to push me out of both rome and naples not to mention the fact that it ties up 45 of my units just to the italian front that on top of getting you a build this year should even things out if not put things in your favor", "yea too early to tell about a lot of this stuff heres to a good alliance", "we should both keep talking to england maybe suggest some orders that would make our attack more effective", "true just to be safe it would be a good idea to dislodge the north sea and prevent any convoys its going to mean england will know whats up but i think our attack is unstoppable anyway i think i can do this with just belgium and english channel", "it might be smart to move norwaysweden and st petersburgnorway in order to try and make a play for denmark too next year", "oh man i wish i could have seen that in time so we could have coordinated", "oh well", "no worries", "i am supporting berlin to kiel so absolutely make sure sevastopol is open for a fleet build probably moscowsevastopol and ukrainesevastopol also try not to let turkey find out because otherwise he might try to support you into sev", "any thoughts on what you want to do with norway", "ok sounds good nwy will move to ska maybe to take denmark since you are already big and it wouldnt really make sense for you to have it after this turnso take it this turn and ill take it back and support u somewhere else instead if thats ok with yo", "sounds good regarding moving to skag we can definitely organize a way to split up english supply centers though i am a bit cautious of doing it now since i expect to be losing supply centers in the short term to austria", "so you moved to the north sea what gives", "yeah last minute i decided that was a better position since one of us should probalby occupy it and it also has access to denmark i hope thats ok and doesnt come accross as agressive i will totally move out of there next turn if u ask me too since you have more fleets that need to get out into the sea", "but i think that turn went amazing i got rum from austria and bounced in sev looks like you did pretty well too i think if we continue this alliance we could totally win", "i think i will go with an army in warsaw instead of a fleet in stp since i broke off the relationship with austria and england doesnt seem like a threat is that good with you or would you preffer me to build in stp to get enland out of the game quickly", "cool we might be better off with you in the north sea actually since it opens up the option to convoy to the island next turn it depends somewhat on english disbands warsaw is fine with me i agree with your logic and we probably have enough units for england anyway", "great thanks mate", "you didnt build a fleet in sevastopol", "the weak point in englands defense is edinburgh so we should try to find a way to take that", "oh god i messed up", "forgot to build", "it happens sometimes i think you still have a strong position in the south unless turkey and austria start working together again", "thoughts on sending north sea to norwegian sea i worry that a convoy is easily distrupted but edinburgh is easy to take if we do that", "any ideas for trieste", "how is a convoy easily disrupted you realize that one has to dislodge a unit in order to stop it from convoying and france cant do that although ig they could stay in edi but moving to the norwegian wouldnt change anything about that", "if youre there we can plan our moves", "i can keep kiel and berlin right since you got the rest of germany so w my unit in kiel maybe i should go to denmark or i could do that with sweden", "triest could support me into venice", "do you want me to convoy one of youre units to edi", "although me moving to venice is pretty risky if austrai and turkey team up", "you could say something to austrai about an alliance to try to get them not too attack you", "sorry for all the messages lol", "how about this a gal vie a kie a mos sev f nth a rum a swe den a ukr s rum a war gal a tri ser a hol edi", "because england will move wales to yorkshire and thus there is no way to convoy to the island", "nthnorwegian sea imo so that i can move my fleet to the north sea but everything else seems ok", "ok any suggestions so im assuming you will move to serbia", "w my fleet in nrth sea i will support you into england if you do me that favor", "also ig kiel will just chill", "i think i have to defend venice from austria but i will try to get austria to make some bad moves", "i think it makes sense to hold in kiel", "maybe move it back to berlin or something", "i could move to serbia it just means ill lose venice and trieste too and edinburgh is unfortunately not guaranteed so i think id have to keep denmark in that scenario to avoid losing 3 supply centers in one turn", "thats not entirly fair chances are you will loose either venice or triest", "and when im in viena i can help u into bud", "so how about we go with what i said and i dont take denmark this turn but i will take it next turnor maybe not depending on what u have for supply centrs", "idk what do u think would be best for both of us on the whole", "that works for me", "k i wont move to denmark this turn then", "i really hope you dont betray me as i think that would be bad for both of us in the long run and if we stick together we are basicaly garunteed a win at this point but if we fight it could escalate and we would destroy eachother", "lol", "i agree betraying at this point would be shortsighted in many ways you are better positioned to stab me than i am to stab you since i have so many units tied up in italy austria and turkey", "well i cant say i agree with the latter but i agree with your first point", "lol france", "i sorta knew u would do that but i wanted to give u a chance", "i have to be honest im pretty disappointed about that", "", "ig i overestimated", "i know what this looks like and i think you should make whichever moves make you more comfortable but i needed to find a way to convince austria to work with me against turkey in the fall and split them up so as a condition i put in these moves that being said its a spring move and so my plan is to reverse the spring by walking back out of kiel and berlin", "i have to say that the austrian moves were an unexpected and great surprise as it will be putting massive strains on turkey and austria working together in the long run", "if anything you have a build in pocket and are picking up vienna and budapest if i was going to stab you i would have chosen a different turn and told austria about you moving to vienna", "lol nice try france if your going to try to persuade me that taking two of my centers isnt betraying me then i dont know what too say and why in the world would you need austria to work with you against turkey youre overrunning the map and turkey is probably the least of your concern right now if you didnt want this too be a betrayal you could have told me and worked something out beforehand and yes i have a builds on my hand but unless you actually do as you say and move out of my centers i wont really have a chance for winning i could have gotten you in denmark and although i considered it i didnt", "but if you do want to work something out and move out of my centers that would be pretty nice", "i mean you will definitely be in the draw if thats what you meant i would have 100 proposed this beforehand but i felt that the plan might be jeapordized if you werent fully on board i get that you feel like you have to move to defend yourself and in that sense it unfortunately makes sense for me to hold onto kiel and berlin since i expect to be losing 2 supply centers in the south and it seems like you arent interested in supporting north sea to edinburgh", "turkey is a cunning player and i fear that with the right tactical positioning turkey would be able to conquer the mediterraneanespecially since i only have 3 fleets to his 4 and considering the superior defensive and offensive position of turkey on the map in regards to naval power", "you keep saying your going to lose centers and you never do your probably going to take munich", "you say you didnt stab me but you are bieng completly unreasonable in everything that you are saying", "in this not losing centers i truly have been extraordinarily lucky but it is bound to end at some point", "well you cant know that", "so what do you want to do", "16 min to figure this out", "its just highly unlikely but i guess it is still theoretically possible for me to continue growing this turn next turn it is impossible as i will no longer be bordering any supply centers that i can possibly take", "so im assuming youre going to take munich", "and your unwilling to give me berlin or kiel back", "my pitch would be eliminating italy austria and england and going for a 3way draw with turkey since at this point we cant eliminate turkey by 1910 not sure what your relationship with turkey is like", "im open to the possibility of giving back either andor not taking munich i think it makes sense for me to keep them unless we can figure out a deal with edinburgh", "also england might be difficult to get down quickly unless we get builds as fleets and send them over there which kind of feels like a waste", "oh god dont get me started on turkey they are really hard to agree with but that is the most likely outcome although if you get a few more centers from austria and stab me u will win", "its not likely when im still on 12 but yeah the other alternative is to keep either england or austria alive and settle for a 4 way draw", "if you want me to trust you i think you should give at least one back as you are much bigger and frankly its probably in your best interest to go for the solo although if the rest of the contries cooperate you almost certaintly wont get it and your definitly going to need me if you want to go for the draw", "but no lets not do 4 way", "f your going to give me one back i think it would make most sense if i had berlin but you would most likely move berlin to pru or sil which is scary even in the most trusting relationship", "thats fair i agree the difference between 3 way and 4 way is pretty significant", "i think a three way is probably possible", "should i message turkey", "sure", "do you know anything about austrias moves", "unless you give me backlet me keep one of them i dont think i will agree to bieng your ally and this game will probably end in a 5 way draw hard cap", "no idea about austria", "so berlin will move to silesia", "", "ahh", "1 minute", "thats a reasonable position to take i can give you one back for sure though maybe it makes more sense to support you to edinburgh for a similar effect and not having me move to silesia", "ok we have one min change ur orders", "no time to work out something for edi", "lol this is stressful", "next time we need to work out something before this close to adjudication", "damn i changed my orders but they didnt go through for some reason", "shit", "yeah that was cutting it way to close", "i dont know if i can believe you but now were fucked", "this is really bad", "lost rum", "and didnt get bud", "that was extremely unlucky in the south turkey and austria guessed completely correctly somehow", "and wow ur working with turkey", "ok i need to go", "tmrow maybe we can try to work out a 3 way draw", "hmm more like the move mutually benefits us as it means he isnt in the gulf of lyons and also means italy is eliminated", "yeh ig", "alright well talk tomorrow for sure", "alhtough tbh u might be able to get the solo", "if you go for it gl", "the south did go very lucky for me last turn but i dont think the dots that i need are within reach for at least a couple years thanks though lol", "so the best way to go for the 3 way draw right now would be for me to move north sea to yorkshire and move skaggerak to north sea while you convoyed an army from norway into clyde this way we can take both london and edinburgh in the fall and next year i would support you to liverpool", "in the south you can easily

dot from me i have a disband this turn and tried to take picardy im not going to forget that im not going to attack you right now and despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game i honestly dont see myself attacking you in the future either germany is the largest threat to me right now and i cant overextend against you without worrying about italy who has a fleet in rome which can only move west", "not to mention you have a build coming and i have a disband theres no chance i can win in a fight against you germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows its the only chance he has to survive if we start working together and for the record i told him id be attacking you right now if and only if he gives me belgium this is a lie but im hoping that i can snag belgium this turn i did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up germany and in general i like to deal with the present situation instead of making longterm plans since the board is constantly changing ill be around to talk more later today but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears", "okay i will continue to support you against germany however i will only accept brest into picardy if mao moves south you have other things to worry about but im not going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy i will move into denmark ideally with russian support and we can see how the situation progresses from there", "if you maintain our alliance for the duration of the conflict against germany i will surrender belgium and holland to you as well", "i will 100 do that if that is what we want to do i dont mean to push it too much as i realize just picardy is a large trust excersize but in the interest of full disclosure i was initially planning to send mao to the english channel i wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on belgium if germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance i lose ruhr and that will make it hard to take belgium again i know its a huge ask so right now im sending mao south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily if you do allow that you would have control over what we do with that unit whether thats convoying london to belgium cutting belgium support to try and capture holland or sending it to belgium with supports from burgundy and picardy", "i can see why youd want mao in ec as a compromise you can keep mao where it is instead of moving south and maybe ec next picardy and ec are two big bites and being able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move",

to send nor west so idk if that will fly with him", "youd be able to conviy into kiel or holland next spring and take the other in the fall for two dots", "yeah he told me he wanted you to put it in edinburgh", "id be fine with that but its a regressive move if anything russia is just worried that youll attack him", "other option if you want to be safe is we can bounce in the english channel", "its slower but we can do all this stuff next year anyway as long as you stay in north sea", "im glad since russias silence was really worrying me but it seems like he was just away for the weekend", "alright that sounds good to me nwg will go to edi north sea can bounce ec and ska will take denmark", "and yeah i was worried too but all is well so thats comforting", "sounds good ordered and in", "you may want to move london out of the way since your re going to have a build and i assume you dont want to build in liverpool", "thats a marvelous point thanks for mentioning that", "so russia", "we probably should have seen that coming since zrussia does honestly really need the build to stop turkey austria from rolling over him", "depending on what russia says you should decide between spending effort to evict russia from norway or letting it go", "russia said there was a discrepancy between what youre telling and him and what i told him what did you communicate to him about my moves", "i just need to find out if he legitimately thought he was in danger or if he acted with malice", "we talked a lot and pretty fast so there is a chance some things got lost in translation but basically i just told him we were bouncing in the channel and we had worked things out", "alright cool he went to bed but im gonna figure out my move in the morning", "any ideas on what you want your next steps to be i dont think russia stabbed you from malice if anything i think well see with russias builds that he does not want to get into conflict with you", "if it is possible to work through this we need to start working on attacking germany asap right now its a clusterfuck and austria turkey are going to roll over the west if we dont work together", "being deprived of a build really kills my momentum on fighting germany one of my fleets will go into securing norway and ill also try to move against germany with one of my fleets", "edi will probably end up in the north sea", "russia didnt like me having so many fleets near him but he stabbed me so hes gonna have to deal with it lol", "if edi will end up in the north sea where is north sea headed to helgoland blight", "ns will go nor", "makes sense im assuming you worked it out with russia since otherwise it would probably bounce", "he said hed vacate nor so heres hoping lol", "you seem very hesitant to attack either germany or me you have to commit to one side at some point though or else nobody will make any progress while turkey starts decimating the east and soloes", "i would highly recommend letting russia keep norway for now because he will need the units against turkey and you can always take norway back later", "meanwhile you have a really good opportunity to take some german centers", "idk it seems like you arent worried about turkeyaustria at all", "you should be very worried think about them as an 11 center power theyre going to roll over italy and russia very very quickly", "it seems like you are so far away so you dont have to worry about it but the truth is that they dont need a single one of your supply centers for one of them to win the game", "as far as i can tell turkey is the stronger partner and austria is mostly just going along with it ive been trying for the past 2 years to get them to fight unsuccessfully though you are welcome to try", "if this pattern continues we will see turkey stab austria once the solo is in sight", "its so much easier to stop right now rather than later or in fact instead of stopping it we could just create a stronger counteralliance", "thats why i want russia to be as strong as possible right now to stop the at in their tracks if you dont want to do that i think we have to hit germany hard right now maybe you can move to the helgoland and take norway in the fall", "while i reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a germany the fact that i have taken denmark and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in denmark ought to indicate that im no longer hesitating to commit while turkeyaustria is a significant threat in the late game im also concerned with not being eliminated in the shortterm the fact of the matter is that i am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect you or powers who have in fact stabbed me russia or would stab if given the chance germany i am more than willing to hit germany right now and move south from denmark but i also need to cover my bases and get nor russia can have centers in germany to combat at", "im willing to be the weaker power in the interest of countering at but i am inclined to think that holding denmark and nor is a very reasonable minimum", "very fair thanks for writing out your thoughts well see what happens but you probably will grow faster than i can germany has so many armies that any successful attack on him hinges on you and russia to some extent", "alright where do you want the danish fleet to move has russia communicated a plan with his armies ill communicate to russia that if i have norway he can take his picking of german centers to combat at", "makes sense to move it to kiel i think", "yeah i was thinking actually that it would make sense to put russia into munich", "russia disappeared again but hopefully we can work that out", "hey i just told russia he can keep nor for now", "i really dont want to have to deal with turkey pushing up to stp or something", "awesome russia told me he would build an army in moscow so if he guesses right he might be able to keep turkey out for now", "everything looks good right now if you sill plan to let russia keep norway then i would recommend ordering north seahelgoland blight denmark kiel and edinburghnorth sea best case scenario you end up in helgoland blight kiel and north sea and can take holland in the fall for a total of both kiel and holland", "i recommend this because i believe that germany trusts you and that he will not make an attempt to defend kiel especially if you tell him that you have your hands full with russia and me", "i hate to ruin the party but there is no chance in hell that germany trusts me they have fully stopped replying to me", "that said im sure their hands are full anyway so ill move into kiel", "oh haha well he isnt talking to me either so i guess he may have given up", "i need you tell me whether or not the idea i just had is stupid if russia trusts the fer alliance i could totally convoy army to livonia and support any of the centers neighboring it is that even worth proposing or should it stay in my head", "support russia defending i mean", "its worth proposing but maybe not at this point since it will take a while to set up anyway thats a great idea for the future i think", "whats your goal with ec", "literally just to take belgium after that it will go south or help you if needed", "alright im gonna trust that since conflict among fer is a bad look given at", "heres a tentative plan kielberlin bohemiamunich silesia s bohemiamunich burgundyruhr english channel s picardybelgium picardybelgium helgolandholland north sea s helgolandholland", "you have almost nothing to worry about you can cover london this turn and have a strong chance to get 2 builds", "you are guaranteed holland under this tentative plan", "okay sounds good", "and unless germany uses munich or ruhr to take kiel highly unlikely youll get that too", "ill copy this plan to russia and we can refine it if necessary then", "alright let me know what russias thoughts are", "will do", "russia said he liked the plan", "alrighty cool", "darn if we knew germany was submitting all hold orders we could have eliminated him this turn that being said this is great progress", "now we should start talking about next steps i think now would be a good time to pitch the livonia thing", "any thoughts for builds also any recommendationsrequests for my build", "id love to attack italy but i dont want to pull him away from defending austriaturkey its hard to say if hed end up getting very angry and throwing supply centers to turkey its a delicate balance", "i will talk to russia about livonia i dont think this is a good time to attack italy it would be better for you to support him in the while russia presumably with my support holdspushes east it is also possible for me to send fleets around iberia into med to help out with supporting italy i will be building armies my fleets will not be super useful in the conflict to come but armies can help russia a lot", "makes sense i agree with all of that", "i sent this to russia", "i am pretty confident that austria will support bohemia to silesia for that reason i recommend warsaw s silesia h munichberlin kiel s munichberlin burgundymunich", "new thought ukrainesevastopol moscow s ukrainesevastopol warsawgalicia silesia s warsawgalicia munichberlin kiel s munichberlin burgundymunich this move set has all of the advantages of both move sets", "anyway it wasnt clear whether russia wanted you to move to livonia or not after my conversation with him but i think it might be worthwhile to convoy to denmark to set up for it anyway", "sorry about the delay ive been in class all morning i asked russia and they were not into it", "ok thats a tough spot to be in so what were you planning to do instead", "if you are up for it i can move to english channel and mid atlantic ocean and then convoy wales to north africa", "i know you recommended earlier that i work with italy but lately i havent been able to get in contact with him if that continues i think our best course of action is moving quickly to try and take those centers before turkey and austria do", "i know you are busy but lets try to nail down a plan before the deadline this time around", "ill be back around later in the day", "alright ive only got class for another couple of hours today so we can talk then", "any new thoughts or updates", "i think italy is a good target if theyre not helping the cause", "have you heard anything new from russia", "nothing new or interesting they want support to kill germany", "sounds good", "hello would you like to set up that naf convoy next turn", "i think so that being said the timing does feel a little bit off if we do it now i also dont really know what the deal is regarding italy austria and turkey", "i really need a build right now and even though russia is getting two builds he seems reluctant to hand off munich to me as previously discussed i wonder if it would be possible for kiel to cut berlins support in case russia gets greedy and tries to support silesia to munich", "are you sure he cant be convinced to surrender it to you if i hit him in berlin that might breakup fer", "have you talked to russia about mun today", "unfortunately not as ive been very busy with everything that has been going on", "alright based on what he told me he intends to keep it", "i cant get a response from him at the moment but i just told him my intentions to support myself there", "in order to keep munich russia would have to use silesia and support himself to munich", "alright do you need me to do anything or am i chillin", "kiel to berlin would be amazing", "alright", "thanks for that it ultimately wasnt necessary and wow did not expect to pick up either rome and venice which actually hurts a lot in terms of containing italy im sure austria and italy will be attacking me next", "sorry forgot to add that cutting berlin makes me even more comfortable than i already was in swinging the rest of my units towards italy", "how do you feel about russia right now", "seems like our alliance is getting pretty testy but he hasnt responded since berlin so idk for sure", "well this is awkward", "if youre willing to cooperate i would be more than willing to surrender german centers in exchange for peace", "besides stuff like kie or even nth makes it look like you and russia are only sort of on the same page", "i am more than happy to coordinate it honestly has been very busy over the past few days for me so i havent been able to talk with you or russia that much", "theres no getting around it i need builds to fuel a campaign against italy and turkey in the south im glad you are looking for an opportunity to make this as amicable as possible i definitely dont intend on going after the island hence sending brest to mao rather than the english channel on top of not being necessary your coasts are extremely well defended", "thats the beauty of leaving three armies on the island lol im willing to give you some builds but unless i get centers somewhere else thats pretty much the end of my support for fer simply because i wont have the units to do anything useful", "i think the way this can work out is having me take holland and russia take kiel", "thats totally reasonable and i think fer may be falling apart soon if russia and i cant figure out our differences soon", "falling apart soon anyway", "hello sorry about the delay im gonna vacate hol and kiel", "id prefer to keep denmark", "you can guarantee that you keep it if you move there", "wow russia was not supposed to go to north sea", "i think your chances of survival are best if you get russia and i to fight right now so even though 3 armies is a great defensive position i might consider keeping edi to fan the flames", "i legitimately thought you would bounce me from denmark the irony that the only reason you have this choice is due to losses from russia and i is not lost on me", "no worries", "so out of curiosity are you gonna try to take my home centers or can i just ride this one out", "im not going to try to take your home centers unless i can solo which is seeming more and more unlikely with builds that indicate a coalition forming against me", "if its any consolation you dont have to worry about my participation in a coalition lmao", "if youre interested in getting me out of the channel im moving channel to north sea right now if edinburgh is free to support that move", "why do you need that you have a fleet in nth dont you", "i dont need it per se but i plan to leave the north sea and there is a good chance that russia may choose to bounce it out with norwegian sea", "alright sounds good", "do you want support to norwegian sea", "supporting nth", "nth would support edi to norwegian sea", "nah im content to chill in edi but ill support you into nwg if you wanna hit that fleet", "sure", "are you and russia gonna work it out", "unfortunately not", "instead of holding with all your units you could always do a yorkshire pudding by sending all of your units to yorkshire", "oh thats true if im gonna sit on this island im gonna have a good time while i do it", "real talk am i deserving of turkeys flame", "i dont see what else i couldve done with 3 builds", "turkey is just upset over the game i think", "if you were going to attack me the time to do it would have been building 2 fleets instead of 2 armies but the context of that turn was me agreeing to move out of english channel and attack italy", "after that you had a significant unit disadvantage", "we should probably move this conversation away from here now that the game is over"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

have much info right now unfortunately our countries definitely compliment eachother through", "ive heard from russia and it seemed like he was a solid player and would probably be a good ally for you the russia turkey alliance is one of the strongest on the board as france it would be a natural for me to help you with that as i am on the other side of the board", "also sorry for the weird communication times ive been in and out since it was a super busy day today and actually missed some of your questions id love to share as much info on our neighbors and ive heard from almost everyone", "no problem at all on that note it sounds like italy may be headed your way of course i cant be sure but thats what he indicated whether thats short or mid term i cant be sure", "thanks for the heads up i appreciate it any more ideas about your own plans in the east", "any new updates on what is going on now that moves have resolved", "pretty sure austria and russia and maybe even italy are all planning to roast turkey given germany is gifting sweden and england doesnt look like putting up any resistance in the north to russia either i think the likelihood of a runaway russia is rising by the minute", "a runaway russia would not be good for me not sure how much i can help though since im on the other side of the board maybe you can convince italy to help you against austria by offering them greece", "nice work getting austria on your side", "russia seems to be well defended but not too strong so i dont know how much more you stand to gain from attacking russia my honest opinion is that you stand more to gain from stabbing austrua", "than continuing to attack russia", "thanks yeah its still definitely very dicey down here but hoping to secure my homelands at least nice one nabbing munich not exactly a common goal to achieve in 1901", "any preferences on who you want to work with it might affect some of my decisions here", "there is zero chance i keep munich so really what it does is slow down germany temporarily from running everyone over with 3 builss", "russia and austria could potentially be attacking you since rumania is an easy picking hopefully one of them is a strong ally", "actually maybe not since i think russia is helping me against germany by moving to silesia", "looks like i had bad information which is too bad since i will be losing munich", "are you still working with austria your moves were especially clever so it looks like you will take sevastopol but it seems like you may have a tough time expanding much further than that you might stall out", "yes maybe but there is still options for work g with austria shame about munich but i think youre still in a pretty good position germany looks to be in a bit of trouble with both you and england threatening", "its a position with next to no growth potential unfortunately well see what happens it seems that both austria and russia are willing to work with you", "do you have any intel on germany or england", "do you have any intel on germany or england", "what are you building", "sorry for my lack of communication been busy here im leaning towards a fleet at this stage i dont have anything on england and germany germany says they are tied up and suggest i go after russia both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is looking at the board right now he doesnt seem particularly concerned with his situation but i may be reading too much into that looks pretty scary for him right now with russia on his doorstep as well as you and england circling", "interesting to see your progress in positioning against italy at some point maybe we can start talking about what the long term on that front looks like", "i wonder if it makes sense for you to actually work with italy here to stab austria", "i cant really see it if you want hit tys again this year and i can support you into tun next year in return", "i marked that as a lie because i think you can see it you and italy could have stabbed austria for 3 supply centers last turn", "what i can see is a good relationship between you and italy a wintergreen from the beginning and a spot for me as the third wheel in that not the most amazing opportunity but maybe im missing something", "thats the case if youre trying to top the board but the way were paid it doesnt matter if you have 17 supply centers or 1", "its not a ton of difference in terms of payment honestly but if you can eliminate somebody without being eliminated yourself id say that youd be better off in general", "im in it for the competition and to win", "but think about all the things you could buy with 2 amazon credit", "lol good point i should reassess my priorities", "well whats your plans now north or east if you want to go east im here", "to help", "i think i might be mostly positioning myself for the future to remain flexible", "how about you are you still committed to playing the slow grind with austria im sure you are already aware of this but we do end the game in winter of 1910", "yup just going to grind it out russia wants to get me thats his sole mission in this game attacking austria isnt going to help defend against them", "looks like austria was convinced to work with russia i wonder if your plan is to try and make up with austria or not", "the german nmr gifting the west annd russia centers and now englands moves have written this game off in my opinion", "i get where you are coming from but i hope you stick it out i think youve forgotten that your loyal ally france has come to save the day", "so what are your plans now i dont want to fight you over the ionian", "just going through the motions happy to do whatever you like really just let me know", "however one thing i would ask is that you hit nap with rom i just want to survive so i need to keep austria out of adr otherwise my units are at your service just dont let russia win please", "sounds good i will definitely be keeping an eye on russia", "austria is already in the adriatic sea unfortunately though", "sorry i meant the ion", "so do you think im allied with italy or something you basically have done the opposite to everything ive asked in relation them which is strange youd have had nap now if you followed through", "you are obviously not allied with italy i dont want you to feel like you are being ignored but ultimately i decided to make the moves that i thought would be best to help me hold onto what i currently have of italy a better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand for which i apologize that being said we would be having a different conversation had i made an explicit commitment towards moving to naples and in terms of results i think you are actually the greatest beneficiary of the moves from last spring so there is also that", "if you would like i can support albania to trieste", "i have to defend greece but thanks", "still there", "nice work on the build by the way", "i agree that you should defend greece any thoughts on what you want to do about your fleet in tunis though maybe we can organize a swap for naples", "sounds fair to me", "and btw my message about greece was sent last season but i forgot to give it the thumbs up so it didnt go through", "i messed that season up though had to just let russia into sev with his army so he couldnt build there and i couldve taken the black sea", "looks like russia failed to build in sev anyway whats your relationship with austria", "that is handy pretty good overall although hes been quiet lately he stabbed me but then russia immediately attacked him so im sure we can work something out", "hes angry at me so not sure how helpful he will be against russia i bet austria will be taking supply centers from me this turn", "nice movesexcept for the austrian hold in budapest which means that rumania was not taken", "im supporting your fleet in tyrhenian to naples as per our earlier agreement to swap tunis for naples", "any idea what the deal is regarding russiaaustria i imagine that austria and russia plan to take a couple dots off of me this turn", "i think the point where i stop making any progress is coming up very soon so id love to start talking about ways this plays out to a draw", "thoughts the bot was down for a short bit", "are you moving to naples", "yes and thanks for the support into it", "sorry been out for a bit", "sounds good no worries", "i was floating the idea of a 3 way draw between you russia and i since it would make sense if we pulled it off correctly", "up to you guys really i will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is getting close to the solo by helping the other i would therefore be happy to take the draw instead", "looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though russia has been playing some subpar moves so the solo is there for you to take", "with the english freebies its pretty much done", "theres no solo in sight right now", "probably makes sense to build an army for you i would think were stalemated in the mediterranean anyway", "im building an army in marseilles for example", "what do you mean theres no solo in sight lol youre on 15 and there are three free centres in england i might not be paying much attention to this game but id have to be blind and dumb not to see that even if there werent freebies there you could get them elsewhere youd have to try harder not to solo from here haha", "sure its definitely possible that being said i also think it would be inconvenient to take english supply centers due to the density of those units", "regarding the three way the best way to do it would probably be to force austria off the map this turn maybe bulgariaserbia with support from rumania while russia supports galicia to budapest", "the only issue would be a retreat to greece or albania so it might be worthwhile to bounce in albania with greece and ion to prevent any retreats", "interesting i didnt mean to take naples i figured you might cut the tyrhenian seas support ill move out if we can call a truce in trieste", "interesting choice to move to albania as it means that turkey can retreat to greece", "austria can retreat to greece", "this game is over spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time im glad you found the moves interesting though i cant stop laughing at i didnt mean to take naples in my experience the best way not to take something is to not attack it thats just what ive found but i guess youve got other methods of not taking something haha of course you meant to take naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons its all the same at this point good game well played if youre trying to rack up lies with me i wouldnt bother i have to conclude that thats the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun if its just for fun carry on i dont mind if its for the successful lie counter russia is a better option for that i think", "well i was trying to get you to not take trieste in the fall i can support it to hold but i suspect that if you and russia are
